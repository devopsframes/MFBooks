AAL8 

Explanation:  DFHALP was processing a request that deadlocked. The most likely reason for the abend is that an ALLOCATE QUEUE request has been suspended because there are no contention-winning links available. AAL1 is issued for non time-out related deadlocks. AAL8 is issued for stall purges and deadlock time-outs. 

System Action:  CICS terminates the task abnormally. A transaction or system dump is not taken unless the transaction dump table has been modified for AAL8. 

User Response:  Ensure that there are enough contention-winning sessions available to satisfy the ALLOCATE QUEUE request. If you are running with modegroups, ensure that there are contention-winning sessions available to satisfy the ALLOCATE request in that modegroup. 

It might be necessary to increase the deadlock timeout (DTIMEOUT) value for the transaction to prevent this abend from recurring. 

If you require a transaction or system dump for this abend then add AAL8 to the transaction dump table.

 Although it is possible that the remote system is sending invalid records, it is more likely to be an error in the receive logic because DFHZARRC (a lower level receive module) also checks the LLs before passing them to CPI Communications. 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. 

User Response:  Use CICS traces and, possibly a VTAM trace, to determine the data that was sent between both systems. 

A level 2 CICS trace for 'CP' of the transaction documents the course of events prior to this error (such as the modules called and their parameters). The level 2 trace also provides details of the error itself.

Module:  DFHCPCRB 

AAOZ 

Explanation:  CPI Communications has detected an invalid ID field in the GDS records it was receiving on a mapped conversation. The exception trace point that accompanies this abend gives the ID field in data 3. The valid IDs are '12FF'X for application data and '12F1'X for null data.

 System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. 

User Response:  Use CICS traces and, possibly, a VTAM trace to determine the data that was sent between both systems. 

A level 2 CICS trace for 'CP' of the transaction documents the course of events prior to this error (such as the modules called and their parameters). The level 2 trace also provides details of the error itself.

Module:  DFHCPCRB 

AAO2 

Explanation:  CPI Communications has detected an unexpected response from DFHLUC. 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. 

User Response:  This is a CICS internal logic error. 

A level 2 CICS trace for 'CP' of the transaction documents the course of events prior to this error (such as the modules called and their parameters). The level 2 trace also provides details of the error itself. 

You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to proceed. 

Module:  DFHCPCBA 

AAO3 

Explanation:  The CPI interface detected that a call was made to a CPI Communications function without CPI Communications being initialized. This implies that CPI Communications initialization failed while CICS was initializing. 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. An exception trace entry is also written when this event occurs.

 User Response:  Check the console listing to determine the reason why CPI Communications failed to initialize during CICS initialization. Correct the 

problem and restart CICS. 

If the console listing indicates that CPI Communications initialized successfully, you need further assistance to resolve the problem. Collect the console 

listing, the traces and the transaction dump. You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to proceed. 

Module:  DFHCPI

AAO4 

Explanation:  DFHZARL, or a module called by DFHZARL, has detected a logic error. This error is almost certainly caused by the module receiving invalid 

data or indicators from VTAM.

 

System Action:  Before returning to the CPI Communications layer, DFHZARL calls DFHZNAC to clean up the session and put out messages on the CSNE 

log. CPI Communications abnormally terminates the transaction with a CICS transaction dump, and produces an exception trace entry.

 

User Response:  Check the CSNE log to determine the type of error. You may need further assistance from IBM to fully resolve this problem. You need 

further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to proceed.

 

Module:  DFHCPCLR

 

AAO5

 Explanation:  The task was purged before a GETMAIN request to the storage manager (SM) domain was able to complete successfully. The domain that 

first detected the purged condition provides an exception trace.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 User Response:  Investigate the reason why the task was purged. It was purged either by the master terminal operator or as a result of deadlock timeout.

 

Modules: DFHCPCBA, DFHCPCBI, DFHCPCBS

 

AAO7

 

Explanation:  The CPI Communications syncpoint request handler has been passed an invalid DFHLUC parameter list. This is a CICS internal logic error.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  A level 2 trace for 'CP' of the transaction shows the course of events before this error occurred (such as the modules called and their 

parameters) plus details of the error itself. You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination 

Guide for guidance on how to proceed.

 

Module:  DFHCPSRH

 

AAO8

 

Explanation:  The CPI Communications syncpoint request handler has been passed an invalid conversation control block (CPC). This is a CICS internal 

logic error.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  A level 2 trace for 'CP' of the transaction shows the course of events before this error occurred (such as the modules called and their 

parameters) plus details of the error itself. You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination 

Guide for guidance on how to proceed.

 

Module:  DFHCPSRH

 

AAO9

 

Explanation:  A task has been purged either as a result of a purge from the master terminal operator via the CEMT transaction, or by the task being timed 

out after waiting for longer than the DTIMOUT (deadlock timeout) value specified for the transaction.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Investigate why the task was purged.

 

If the task was purged by the master terminal operator, this may have been in an attempt to clear the system which appeared to be deadlocked for some 

reason.

 

If the task was timed out automatically as a result of the DTIMOUT value being exceeded, this may be due to insufficient main storage being available for the 

number of tasks in the system. If the amount of main storage cannot be increased, the number of tasks in the system should be reduced to avoid 

short-on-storage situations. Another possibility would be to increase the value of the DTIMOUT option for the transaction.

 

Module:  DFHCPCLR

 

ABAC

 

Explanation:  An activity issued EXEC CICS RETURN (without the ENDACTIVITY option) but no events were processed during the activation. The activity 

was executed with a RUN command.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. The EXEC CICS HANDLE ABEND command cannot handle this abend.

 

User Response:  Investigate why the activity did not process any events.

 

Module(s): DFHBASP

 

ABAD

 

Explanation:  An activity issued EXEC CICS RETURN ENDACTIVITY while there were activity completion events pending. The activity was executed with a 

RUN command.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. The EXEC CICS HANDLE ABEND command cannot handle this abend.

 

User Response:  Investigate why the activity had pending activity completion events.

 

Module(s): DFHBASP

 

ABAE

 

Explanation:  An activity issued EXEC CICS RETURN (without the ENDACTIVITY option) but no events were processed during the activation. The activity 

was executed with a LINK command.

 

System Action:  The task which issued the LINK is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. The EXEC CICS HANDLE ABEND command 

cannot handle this abend.

 

User Response:  Investigate why the activity did not process any events.

 

Module(s): DFHEIBAM

 

ABAF

 

Explanation:  An activity issued EXEC CICS RETURN ENDACTIVITY while there were activity completion events pending. The activity was executed with a 

LINK command.

 

System Action:  The task which issued the LINK is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. The EXEC CICS HANDLE ABEND command 

cannot handle this abend.

 

User Response:  Investigate why the activity had pending activity completion events.

 

Module(s): DFHEIBAM

 

 

 

 

ABLA

 

Explanation:  The task was purged before a GETMAIN request to the storage manager (SM) domain was able to complete successfully. The domain that 

first detected the purged condition provides an exception trace.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Investigate why the task was purged. It was purged either by the master terminal operator or as a result of deadlock timeout.

 

If the task was purged by the master terminal operator, this may have been in an attempt to clear the system which appeared to be deadlocked for some 

reason.

 

If the task was timed out automatically as a result of the DTIMOUT value being exceeded, this may be due to insufficient main storage being available for the 

number of tasks in the system. If the amount of main storage cannot be increased, the number of tasks in the system should be reduced to avoid 

short-on-storage situations. Another possibility would be to increase the value of the DTIMOUT option for the transaction.

 

Modules: DFHMCP, DFHMCPE, DFHM32, DFHPBP, DFHRLR

 

ABLB

 

Explanation:  An error (INVALID, DISASTER, or unexpected EXCEPTION response) has occurred on a call to the storage manager (SM) domain. The 

domain that detected the original error provides an exception trace, a console message and, possibly, a system dump (depending on the options in the dump 

table).

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Please see the related message produced by the domain that originally detected the error.

 

Modules: DFHMCP, DFHMCPE, DFHM32, DFHPBP, DFHRLR

 

ABMA

 

Explanation:  The user has supplied a terminal I/O area (TIOA) with an invalid data length that was either equal to zero or greater than the storage 

accounting length minus 12.

 

Alternatively, the length field of a header or trailer area provided by the application program is invalid (that is, not positive).

 

Problem Determination:  The output services work area (OSPWA) is in user storage and will be printed in a transaction dump. It is addressed by register 2 

at the time of the abend.  Relevant fields are:

 

   OSPTR7

   OSPHDRA

   OSPTRLA

Register 4 or OSPTIOA points to the TIOA. In the TIOA, the following fields are relevant:

    TIOATDL

   TIOASAL

Analysis:

 

  Register    Label      Description

 

  R4=@TIOA    PBCKTDL    TIOATDL is zero or greater

                         than TIOASAL-12.

 

  R2=@OSPWA   PBD20080   R0 (= first halfword of

  R0=length              trailer)  is zero.

  of trailer             R8=OSPTRLA.

  R8=@trailer            OSPTR7 has X'20' bit set.

 

  R2=@OSPWA   PBDTXHDR   R0 (= first halfword of

  R8=@header             header) is zero.

  R0=length              R8=OSPHDRA.

   of header.            OSPTR7 has X'40' bit set.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Correct the program that supplied the erroneous data length.

 

Check the TIOA. If either of the conditions described is present, check the application program. For programs using command-level interface, the TIOA is 

obtained by CICS using the length of the data item passed in the FROM option on an EXEC CICS SEND MAP or EXEC CICS SEND TEXT command, or in 

the TRAILER or HEADER option on an EXEC CICS SEND TEXT or an EXEC CICS SEND PAGE command.  Check the data item for zero length.

 

Header and trailer records have a special format described in the CICS Application Programming Reference. An ABMA abend occurs if the first halfword (the 

length) is not positive. Check the remainder of the header/trailer record for validity when the length is checked.

 

Modules: DFHPBP, DFHMCP

 

ABMB

 

Explanation:  The user has specified a cursor position in the BMS output request. It is larger than the current screen size for the 3270 for which output is 

being built.

 

Problem Determination:  If the abend occurs in DFHPBP:

 

At the time of the abend, register 2 points to the OSPWA and register 1 to the TTP. Relevant fields are:

 


   OSPTR3 has X'10' bit set to indicate a user-specified cursor position

 


   OSPCP contains a halfword cursor position specified by user

 


   TTPSCSZ contains the halfword value of the screen size to compare against.

 

 

If the abend occurs in DFHMCP or DFHMCX:

 

   OSPCP contains a halfword cursor position specified by user

 


   OSPTR3 has X'10' bit set to indicate a user-specified cursor position

 


   OSPSCSZ contains the halfword value of the screen size to compare against.

 

 

Analysis:

 

  Register    Label     Description

 

  In DFHPBP:

  R2=@OSPWA   PBDBADC   OSPTR3 X'10' bit set

                        indicates the user-

  R1=@TTP               specified cursor

                        OSPCP halfword cursor

                        position.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Correct the program that specified the incorrect cursor location.

 

Use trace to identify the statement issuing the request. Check that the cursor position is being correctly set. The program may have been designed to run in 

alternate screen size mode but is being run in default screen size mode, or it may have been designed to run on a 3270 model different from the one in use. If 

the program is routing a message, the route list should be checked. If the program is to run with various 3270 models, the cursor position should be within 

the size of the smallest screen.

 

Modules: DFHPBP, DFHMCP (for minimum-function BMS), DFHMCX

 

 

 

 

ABMC

 

Explanation:  The CMSG transaction is attempting to send a message to a greater number of terminals than is possible. There is no fixed maximum 

because the value depends on the other operands specified on the routing command.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Redefine the route list.

 

Module:  DFHMCP

 

 

 

 

ABMD

 

Explanation:  DFHTPR or DFHTPP has issued a DFHDI TYPE=SEND and has received a return code other than "FUNCERR-REQUEST FOR CHANGE 

DIRECTION SIGNALED" or "NORESP"

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Inform your system programmer.

 

Modules: DFHTPP, DFHTPR

 

ABME

 

Explanation:  DFHTPR or DFHTPP has detected an invalid datastream or DFHWBBMS detected invalid forms data while processing a basic mapping 

support (BMS) request.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. If the ABEND was issued from DFHTPR or DFHTPP then register 

7 indicates the location at which the ABEND was detected.

 

User Response:  If DFHTPR or DFHTPP issued the ABEND then examine the transaction dump for bad data in the TIOA. If the origin of the bad data is an 

application program, correct the program. If DFHWBBMS issued the ABEND then check the validity of the incoming forms data in the CICS trace.

 

Modules: DFHTPP, DFHTPR, DFHWBBMS

  

ABMF

 

Explanation:  The value specified for the length option of the basic mapping support (BMS) send map is greater than the length of the 'from' area.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Redefine the value for the length option.

 

Module:  DFHPBP

  

ABMG

 

Explanation:  The user has requested a basic mapping support (BMS) service that was not specified at system generation, or at initialization.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Correlate services requested against options specified in the system generation of BMS.

 

Follow this procedure:

 

1.  Scan the trace table for the transaction ID that issued the abend. If this is CSPQ (page cleanup), module DFHTPQ abnormally terminated because a 

    message purge delay of zero has been specified and CSPQ has been entered via a terminal. The message purge delay is specified in the PRGDLAY of 

    the DFHSIT macro, and its value can be found in SITPRGD.

 

2.  Scan the trace table for the last BMS request (code 'FA'). Use the option bytes at the start of the failing module to see if the requested functions have 

    been generated. For example, paging may have been requested, but standard or minimum BMS was specified in the SIT.

 

3.  If the BMS request is compatible with the BMS options in the CICS system generation, some incompatible suffixing amongst BMS modules must have 

    occurred. This can happen if the DFHSIT macro specified individual suffixes for the BMS modules.

 

 

The following modules differ between standard and full-function BMS:

 

    DFHMCP

    DFHRLR

    DFHPBP

    DFHTPP

 

Modules: DFHMCP, DFHTPQ

 

ABMI

 

Explanation:  The map specified for a BMS input mapping request was not an input map.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Either define another input map or redefine the existing map.

 

Modules: DFHMCP, DFHMCX, DFHMCY

 

ABML

 

Explanation:  The terminal control locate routine received invalid data from DFHRLR and returns with an error return code. DFHRLR is attempting to scan the 

TCT for a BMS ROUTE request with LIST=ALL or operator class or operator ID specified in the route list. The terminal control table may have been corrupted.

 

Problem Determination:  Register 11 points to the current TCTTE in the search.

 

The TCT prefix (DFHTCTFX) can be located from CSATCTBA.

 

The first terminal entry (TCTTE) in the TCT is addressed by TCTVTEBA.

 

TCTTETEL is the halfword offset from current TCTTE to the next.

 

Analysis: The current TCTTE address is either not on a full-word boundary or is not within the limits of the TCT, or the address of the next TCTTE, obtained 

by adding TCTTETEL to the current address, is invalid. This check is made by locate code (DFHZLOC) in DFHZCX.

 

  Register    Label    Description

  R11=@TCTTE  RLRLOCN  Issue DFHTC CTYPE=LOCATE

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to 

proceed.

 

The terminal control table has probably been corrupted during execution. Attempt to scan through the TCT in a dump. (Because the system dump uses the 

same technique for printing all TCTTEs, the system dump fails at the same point.)

 

Determine which entry is incorrect. It may be that the TCTTE has been overwritten by user data that is recognizable in the dump.

 

Check the application program for references to the TCTTE pointer. Check for user data that may be addressed from the same pointer.

 

In an assembler program, there may be multiple equates for the TCTTE base register.

 

It may be that the TCT is being overwritten by some earlier transaction. If this is so, it is probably one associated with the terminal whose TCTTE is 

overwritten.

 

Modules: DFHRLR for full-function BMS

 

 

 

 

ABMM

 

Explanation:  An invalid map was specified.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Use the supplied dump to diagnose the problem. Register 6 contains the address of the BMS instruction being executed when the error 

was recognized.

 

Module:  DFHPBP

 

 

ABMO

 

Explanation:  The map specified for a BMS output mapping request was not an output map.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Either define another output map or redefine the existing map.

 

Modules: DFHMCP, DFHMCX, DFHMCY

  

ABMQ

 

Explanation:  The query transaction (CQRY) has been initiated and either the task is not terminal-oriented, or the associated terminal is not defined to CICS 

as a 3270 or SCSPRINT device. This abend will occur if CQRY is entered at a console, even when the console is a 3270 device, since the console has the 

appearance to CICS of a keyboard/printer device. The CQRY transaction does not have an operator interface, and under normal conditions there is no need 

for an operator to invoke CQRY or for a user transaction to START the CQRY transaction. CQRY is run automatically by CICS when a 3270 or SCSPRINT 

device connects. In the transaction dump, register 8 contains the address of the TCTTE for the associated terminal. If register 8 contains zero, this indicates 

that the task is not terminal-oriented.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS dump.

 

User Response:  Ensure that the terminal associated with CQRY is of the 3270 or SCSPRINT family of devices.

 

Module:  DFHQRY

 

ABMR

 

Explanation:  The Page Retrieval transaction (CSPG) has been initiated but the task is not terminal-oriented.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS dump.

 

User Response:  Ensure that a terminal is associated with the CSPG transaction.

 

Module:  DFHTPR

 

 

ABMU

 

Explanation:  The application program supplied an address that is not within region boundaries. The low-order 3 bytes of general register 1 in the transaction 

dump contain the erroneous address. The high-order byte of register 1 indicates the address type as follows:

  

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Correct the application program that is supplying the erroneous address.

 

Modules: DFHMCP, DFHEMS

  

ABMV

 

Explanation:  DFHRLR has detected an invalid route list entry.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Check that the route list is correctly built with reserved field in the entry containing blank and a stopper of halfword X'FFFF' to terminate the 

list.

 

Module:  DFHRLR

 

ABMX

 

Explanation:  A text string passed to BMS contained a set attribute order that was invalid for one of the following reasons:

 

1.  The set attribute sequence was less than three characters.

2.  The attribute type was invalid.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Correct the application program.

 

Module:  DFHPBP

 

ABMY

 

Explanation:  BMS is building a TTP (Terminal Type Parameter) control block but the pagesize selected for a terminal by BMS is zero because either the 

default or alternate screensize has been defined as zero.

 

In the transaction dump, significant general purpose register contents are as follows:

 

1.  Register 6 points to the BMS extension of the TCTTE

2.  Register 10 points to the TTP (Terminal Type Parameter) control block

3.  Register 11 points to the TCTTE

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Check the TERMINAL and TERMTYPE definitions which determined the attributes of the offending TCTTE.

 

Module:  DFHRLR

 

 

 

 

ABMZ

 

Explanation:  The address of the terminal I/O area (TIOA) in TCTTEDA was found to be zero.

 

When using BMS fast path as a result of an EXEC CICS RECEIVE MAP, DFHEMS always initializes TCTTEDA with the address of the TIOA. If TCTTEDA is 

subsequently found to be zero by DFHMCX, an overwrite must have occurred.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Investigate why TCTTEDA is zero.

 

Scan the trace table for the last BMS request (code FA) for the failing task and try to determine which user programs have been given control since that BMS 

request.

 

Modules: DFHMCP, DFHMCX, DFHMCY

 

ABM0

 

Explanation:  The map specified for a basic mapping support (BMS) request could not be located.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Check if the map has been defined. If it has, check that it has been specified correctly.

 

Modules: DFHMCP, DFHMCX, DFHMCY

 

 

 

 

ABM1

 

Explanation:  A basic mapping support (BMS) service is requested by a task associated with a terminal that is not supported by BMS. The request is not a 

routing request.

 

Problem Determination:  At the time of the abend, register 11 addresses the TCTTE, and TCTTETEA and register 6 address the TCTTE extension, 

TCTETTE.

 

Relevant fields are:

 

  TCTTEDDS  the device dependent suffix.

  TCTTEMSS  the map set suffix.

 

Analysis: DFHRLR tests the device dependent suffix and the map set suffix in the TCTTE extension. If both of these are zero, the terminal is not supported 

by BMS and DFHRLR abends the task with the abend code ABM1.

 

  Register  Label     Description

 

  R4=       RLRSFXCK  TCTEDDS=X'00' and

                      TCTEMSS=X'00'.

  @TCTTETE            The device dependent suffix

                      and the map set suffix have

                      loaded into the lower two

                      bytes of register 3 by the

                      subroutine RLRSUFXS.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Do not use terminals not supported by BMS for applications using BMS services.

 

Check the terminal type and model number. Confirm that it is a terminal that is not supported by BMS. A list of terminals supported by BMS is given in the 

CICS Application Programming Guide. Check that the TCT macro for the terminal accurately describes the physical terminal.

 

Module:  DFHRLR

 

ABM2

 

Explanation:  No user data was supplied for this BMS request. That is, the address of a user data area was not found in either TCTTEDA or TCAMSIOA.

 

When a BMS macro level output request is issued, the user must have placed the address of the data to be passed to BMS in TCTTEDA or TCAMSIOA 

before issuing the macro. The choice is made on the following criteria:

 


   If the data is to be passed in a TIOA by a terminal-oriented task, the address of this TIOA may be placed either at TCTTEDA, or in TCAMSIOA together 

 

    with the setting of binary zeros into TCTTEDA.

 


   If the data is being passed by a terminal-oriented task but not in a TIOA, the address of the TIOA-like area of this data must be placed in TCAMSIOA and 

 

    binary zeros set into TCTTEDA.

 


   If the data is being passed by a non-terminal-oriented task, the address of the TIOA-like area of this data must be placed in TCAMSIOA. TCTTEDA 

 

    cannot be referenced, because there is no TCTTE associated with this task.

 

 

If a task attempts to pass addresses from both TCTTEDA and TCAMSIOA, the address in TCTTEDA is the one selected.

 

Problem Determination:  The output services work area (OSPWA) is addressed by register 9. The TCTTE is addressed by register 11. The TCA is 

addressed by register 12.

 

The relevant fields are:

 

Field     Description

OSPIND01  OSPWA indicator byte 1

OSPIOA    Alternate I/O area address

OSPSIOA   Address of address of data (TCTTEDA/TCAMSIOA)

OSPTIOA   Address of user data found by BMS

OSPTR1-8  BMS request data saved from the TCA

TCTTEDA   Terminal data area address

TCAFCI    Facility control indicator

TCAMSIOA  Alternate I/O area address

 

Analysis: The ABM2 abend is invoked at one point in DFHMCP, at label MCPABEND. There are five regions in DFHMCP in which the user's data is sought:

 

                                         Labels

 

  TYPE=MAP                               MCPMAP

  TYPE=PAGEBLD,DATA=YES/ONLY             MCPPGBLD

                                         MCPGTIOA

  TYPE=TEXTBLD,DATA=YES/ONLY             MCPPGBLD

                                         MCPGTIOA

  Mapping but not PAGEBLD,DATA=YES/ONLY  MCPMAPNG

  No (mapping,PAGEBLD,TEXTBLD,PAGEOUT)   MCPDFALT

 

"Mapping" refers to BMS requests that specify maps, that is OSPTR3 bits 5 or 6 or 7 or OSPTR4 bit 3 set on.

 

Each of these functional regions does a BAL to subroutine MCPFTIOA to search for a user data area. If a valid area (abend ABMU if not) is found, its address 

is put into OSPTIOA and the address of the data address (of TCAMSIOA or TCTTEDA) is set into OSPSIOA. If a data area is not found, OSPTIOA is cleared 

and OSPSIOA is now loaded with the address of OSPTIOA as a null data area.

 

On the BAL return, OSPTIOA is tested for a nonzero value. If it is zero, a branch to MCPABEND is taken.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  The programmer must place the address of the data into TCTTEDA or TCAMSIOA, whichever is appropriate.

 

Firstly, check that the user has loaded TCTTEDA or TCAMSIOA with the address of the user data, by checking the application listing and the contents of 

TCTTEDA and/or TCAMSIOA.

 

Next, check that the BMS request has been correctly decoded by CICS by referring to the OSPWA request bytes (OSPTR1-8) or decoding the last BMS 

entry in the trace table. See OSPIND01 to check correct decoding of PAGEBLD or TEXTBLD, and TCAFCI bit 7 to identify whether the task is 

terminal-oriented or not.

 

At the abend point, register 1 contains the user data address last loaded, and register 4 the address of OSPTIOA as an address of null data.

 

If a CICS error is suspected, concentrate initially on subroutine MCPFTIOA, because this is a simple piece of code that shows the data-fetch logic. ABM2 

condition is trapped early in the CICS decoding of the DFHBMS request and involves module DFHMCP only.

ABM3

 

Explanation:  A BMS input or output request has been issued from a task that is not terminal-oriented.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS dump.

 

User Response:  The task issuing a BMS input or output request must be attached to a terminal.

 

Module:  DFHMCP

 

 

 

 

ABM4

 

Explanation:  An invalid request response has been received to a temporary storage PUT or PUTQ request issued by BMS. The data passed to the 

temporary storage program has an invalid length.

 

Problem Determination:  Abend in DFHMCP (see Analysis)

 

The OSPWA (output services work area) is in user storage and is printed in a transaction dump. It is addressed by register 9 at the time of the abend.  

Relevant fields are:

 

  OSPTITLE

  OSPTTCNT

  OSPPLTI

  OSPTOTPG

 

The message control record (MCR) is an area of user storage obtained by BMS. It is addressed by register 8 at the time of the abend. The first 8 bytes 

contain storage accounting information. MCRLLBB contains the length of the MCR (halfword) abend in DFHTPP.

 

The page buffer is addressed by register 7 at the time of the abend. It contains storage accounting fields in the first 8 bytes and a halfword length at offset 8 

(TSIOAVRL).

 

In both cases, the temporary storage use map (DFHTSMAP) is addressed from CSATSATA. TSMAPCOM contains the number of available bytes in a control 

interval on the temporary storage data set.

 

Analysis: If the temporary storage request preceding the abend is a DFHTS PUT, the abend occurred in DFHMCP. If the temporary storage request 

preceding the abend is a DFHTS PUTQ, the abend occurred in DFHTPP. If the abend occurred in DFHMCP, DFHMCP is attempting to put the message 

control record to temporary storage. Check the length of the MCR (MCRLLBB). It may be negative.

 

The length of the MCR is calculated by code following label MCPNODDS and is:

 

  28 + 21 * OSPTTCNT + (length of title record)

                     + (space for page/LDC table,

                        if needed)

 

The address of the title record is at OSPTITLE and the length is contained in the first halfword. Space for the page/LDC table is required if OSPPLT1 is 

nonzero, which should occur only for messages routed to LDC devices (3600, 3650, 3767, 3770, 3790). The number of entries is in OSPTOTPG. 2 bytes are 

required per entry.

 

If the abend occurred in DFHTPP, BMS is attempting to add a page to the temporary storage queue, and the page buffer will not fit in the control interval. 

TSIOAVRL contains the length of the page buffer.

 

For messages directed to 3270 devices, the page buffer consists of a 3270 data stream with a 4-byte page control area following it (a 3270 data stream may 

be larger than the number of characters available on the screen, particularly if extended 3270 attributes are used). For messages directed to other devices, 

the page buffer consists of a message formatted with NL characters, a 4-byte page control area following it. The length in TSIOAVRL should be less than the 

length in the preceding storage accounting area, otherwise an error has occurred in constructing the page, possibly in prior BMS requests.

 

In either of the above cases, if the length of the area being output appears valid, it is necessary to increase the control interval size for the temporary storage 

data set.

ABM5

 

Explanation:  A DFHTS TYPE=PURGE request has been issued with an invalid REQID. This incorrect request was issued by basic mapping support (BMS).

 

DFHTPR cannot find the terminal identifier for the current terminal in the terminal list in the message control record (MCR).

 

Problem Determination:  The TS identifier is built in TCATSDI before the TS purge is issued, although this has probably been overwritten before the dump is 

taken. The trace table entry for the DFHTS TYPE=PURGE contains the TS identifier in the last 8 bytes.

 

The OSPWA is addressed by register 9.

 

OPSTSID temporary storage identifier (8 bytes).

 

Register 8 points to the MCR.

 

Register 5 points to the current entry.

 

Register 0 points to the end of table.

 

Register 9 points to the TCTTE.

 

The terminal list starts at MCRIDLST and the terminal identifier is at the start of the terminal entry. Each terminal entry is X'15' bytes long.

 

Analysis: DFHMCP uses the temporary storage identifier in OSPTSID.

 

Cannot find the terminal identifier for this terminal in the terminal list in the MCR.

                        cannot be found, links to

                        TPRSNH to raise the abend.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Check the trace table and find the preceding PUT/PUTQ TS requests. Check whether the identifier for the PUT/PUTQ is the same as that 

for the PURGE. If it is not, find out how they differ. Check to see if the OSPWA has been corrupted.

 

This error is very unlikely, as the label indicates (TPRSNH - "Should Not Happen"). DFHTPS has scanned the MCR to identify the terminals to which this 

message is directed, and has created an AID to initiate CSPG (DFHTPR) at each of them. However, when DFHTPR retrieves the MCR, it cannot find the 

current terminal identifier in the list of terminals. Presumably the MCR has been corrupted between creation of the AID and dispatching of CSPG at the 

terminal. Check back through the trace table to find the instance of DFHTPS that built the AID for this terminal (transaction CSPS); it will have issued a TC 

LOCATE request to verify that the terminal identifier is valid, and this identifier can be seen in the trace entry.

Explanation:  The bridge exit is disabled.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. The user transaction will not be started.

 

User Response:  Identify why the bridge exit is disabled. Enable the bridge exit and retry the action.

 

Modules: DFHBRMS, DFHBRTC

 

ABRE

 

Explanation:  The bridge exit could not be loaded.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. The user transaction will not be started.

ABRG

 

Explanation:  An invalid bridge facility token was specified

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. The user transaction will not be started.

 

User Response:  This error was probably caused by the incorrect data being sent to the bridge exit from the client application.

 

Check the data set by tracing the data sent from the client application.

 

Ensure that the bridge facility token in the data transmitted by the application is correct.

 

Module:  DFHBRXM

 

ABRH

 

Explanation:  The bridge facility token specified is not known to CICS.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. The user transaction will not be started.

 

User Response:  The most likely error is that the client application specified too small a keep time for the bridge facility. Before the client reused the bridge 

facility token, CICS had already discarded it. Check the bridge facility keep time in the outbound messages. CICS will use the keep time value specified in 

the last message used by a transaction. Alternatively use the trace or CEDX to look at the keep time in the BRXA passed back on the terminate call to the 

bridge exit.

 

Another possible error is that the client application passed a request to a CICS system other than that on which the original request was sent. Bridge 

facilities are only valid on a single CICS system.

 

Module:  DFHBRXM

 

ABRI

 

Explanation:  There are no free bridge facility tokens available. This is probably due to excessive keep time values being specified on the bridge exit 

termination call.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. The user transaction will not be started.

 

User Response:  Review the keep time values used by the client applications. If some client applications are returning excessive values, modify the bridge 

exit to specify a limit to the values.

 

Module:  DFHBRXM

 

ABRJ

 

Explanation:  An invalid FACILITYLIKE value was specified.

 

The FACILITYLIKE value can be specified on the bridge exit initialization call. If the default value (blanks) is returned, the value in the user transaction profile 

definition is used. If no FACILITYLIKE value is specified in the profile definition, a value of CBRF is used.

 

The name must be that of an installed VTAM 3270 terminal.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. The user transaction will not be started.

 

User Response:  Define the terminal specified by FACILITYLIKE, change the value on the profile definition, change the value supplied by the client 

application, or install a terminal definition for CBRF

 

Module:  DFHBRXM

 

ABRK

 

Explanation:  The USERID check failed following the call to the bridge exit.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. The user transaction will not be started.

 

User Response:  Enter the correct password. If the password is correct or was not supplied, review the RACF definitions.

 

Module:  DFHBRXM

 

 

 

 

ABRN

 

Explanation:  The bridge exit returned a value in BRXA_RESP that is not valid for the command for which it was invoked.

 

System Action:  The transaction is backed out.

 

User Response:  Change the bridge exit to only return valid response settings.

 

Modules: DFHBRIC, DFHBRMS, DFHBRSP, DFHBRTC

 

ABRQ

 

Explanation:  The bridge exit issued an abend.

 

System Action:  The transaction is backed out.

 

User Response:  Identify why the bridge exit abended.

 

Modules: DFHBRMS, DFHBRTC

 

 

 

 

ABRR

 

Explanation:  The user transaction's profile could not be found.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. The user transaction is not started.

 

User Response:  Check that the profile name in the user transaction definition is correct, and that this profile has been defined.

 

Module:  DFHBRXM

 

 

 

 

ABRY

 

Explanation:  CICS returned an unexpected error running the bridge exit. This is a CICS internal error.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to 

proceed.

 

Modules: DFHBRMS, DFHBRTC

Explanation:  The bridge exit returned invalid data in the BRXA.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  If a user supplied bridge exit was used, review the format of the data returned by the exit.

 

If a CICS supplied exit was used, this is a CICS error. You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem 

Determination Guide for guidance on how to proceed.

 

Modules: DFHBRIC, DFHBRMS, DFHBRSP, DFHBRTC, DFHXMBR

 

 

 

 

ABR3

 

Explanation:  An unsupported BMS request was received by the bridge exit.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  The bridge only supports minimum function BMS and SEND TEXT. This transaction cannot be used in a bridge environment.

 

Module:  DFHEMS

 

ABR4

 

Explanation:  The link DFHL3270 command did not specify a commarea.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  The link DFHL3270 command must specify a commarea to contain the BRIH and any message vectors.

 

Module:  DFHBRMR

 

ABR5

 

Explanation:  The commarea specified in the link DFHL3270 command is shorter than the BRIH.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  The link DFHL3270 command must specify a commarea to contain the BRIH and any message vectors.

 

Module:  DFHBRMR

 

ABR6

 

Explanation:  The commarea specified in the link DFHL3270 command does not contain a valid BRIH.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  The link DFHL3270 command must specify a commarea which must contain a valid BRIH.

 

Module:  DFHBRMR

 

ABSA

 

Explanation:  A message passed to DFHBSMSG is too long. This is a CICS internal error.

 

System Action:  CICS terminates the task abnormally with a dump.

 

User Response:  You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to 

proceed.

 

Module:  DFHTBS

 

ABXA

 

Explanation:  A next BRMQ vector in the input message passed to the formatter is the wrong type of a RECEIVE vector. RECEIVE and RECEIVE MAP 

have separate vectors.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  This may just indicate that the transaction has gone down an error path which should result in a transaction backout. If not, the input 

message should have a BRMQ vector for this command. Change the client application, recompile and retry.

 

Module:  DFH0CBRF

 

ABXB

 

Explanation:  The BRIH requested that outbound BMS vector must include the ADS descriptor.  The map did not contain an ADS descriptor. This means 

that the mapset was not assembled with CICS TS 1.2 or later.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Either reassemble the mapset using the current level of BMS macros, or set BRIH-ADSDESCRIPTOR to BRIHADSD-NO (the default value 

is BRIHADSD-YES). Note that BRIHADSD-YES is required when codepage conversion of the Link3270 message is required (e.g. using ECI). If you need to 

reassemble the mapset and don't have the mapset source, the utility DFHBMSUP can be used to recreate it.

 

Module:  DFHBRMF

 

ABXC

 

Explanation:  An error occurred when a SYNCPOINT request was issued by the bridge exit.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Check for other CICS messages and exception trace entries to investigate the cause of the SYNCPOINT error.

 

Module:  DFH0CBRE

Module:  DFH0CBAE,DFH0CBRE

 

ABXH

 

Explanation:  The user transaction issued a request which requires more data (such as a RECEIVE request). No data was available in the message, and 

mqcih-conversationaltask was set to mqcct-no which specifies that the transaction is non conversational.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  This may be correct behaviour as defined by the client application. If it is not, the client application should either supply additional data, or 

be redesigned to allow the transaction to be conversational.

 

Module:  DFH0CBRF

 

ABXI

 

Explanation:  A message received by the bridge exit, exceeded the maximum message size.

 

System Action:  An exception trace is made of the first 4K of data in error. The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Check that the client application is passing the correct data. If it is, it will be necessary to change the size of the buffer. This is in field 

block-length in the sample exit. Recompile and reload the exit and retry.

 

Module:  DFH0CBAE,DFH0CBRE

 

ABXJ

 

Explanation:  The bridge exit detected an error in the MQCIH header passed by the client application.

 

System Action:  An exception trace is written containing the MQCIH header. The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  The client application has either not set the MQCIH header, or is using a version of the header which is incompatible with the bridge exit. 

Correct the client application. Recompile, reload and retry.

 

Module:  DFH0CBAE,DFH0CBRE

 

ABXK

 

Explanation:  The bridge exit detected an error in the data passed on the BRDATA parameter of the START command.

Module:  DFH0CBAE,DFH0CBRE

 

ABXM

 

Explanation:  The bridge exit or formatter was called with a function or command which it doesn't support. This either indicates a storage overwrite, or that 

the bridge exit is not designed for this command.

 

System Action:  An exception trace is made of the data in error. The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Check the BRXA data in the trace to see if there has been a storage overwrite, or whether the exit supports this command.

 

Module:  DFH0CBAE,DFH0CBRE,DFH0CBRF

 

ABXN

 

Explanation:  The formatter detected that the input message was truncated.

 

System Action:  An exception trace is made of the first 4K of the message. The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Check that the transport mechanism allows for messages of this length. If this is correct, it indicates that the client application is issuing 

an incorrect message. Trace the outbound message on the client application. Recompile, reload and retry.

 

Module:  DFH0CBRF

 

ABXO

 

Explanation:  The formatter detected an error in a BRMQ vector passed by the client application.

 

System Action:  The field MQCIH-ERROROFFSET is set to indicate the position of the error in the message An exception trace is made of the MQCIH and 

BRMQ vector. The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

System Action:  An exception trace is made of any error information. The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Check for other CICS messages and exception trace entries to investigate the cause of the open error.

 

Module:  DFH0CBRE

 

ABXU

 

Explanation:  The conversion between client code page and server code page is not supported by CICS/390; for example conversion has been requested 

between Japanese code page 932 and Latin-1 code page 500.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Ensure that the Client codepage, both default and overrides are in the same group as the Server codepage. for example client code page 

852 from Latin-2 group, is only supported to server code page 870.

 

Module:  DFHBRMF

 

ABXV

 

Explanation:  The client code page which has been requested by the client is not one which CICS can support.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Ensure that the Client codepage is valid.

 

Module:  DFHBRMF

 

ABX1

 

Explanation:  The bridge exit or formatter was called with an invalid BRXA-HEADER. This indicates a storage overwrite.

 

System Action:  An exception trace is made of the data in error. The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

As CICS also does a check of the BRXA on return from the call to the exit, there will probably be a subsequent ABRZ abend.

 

User Response:  Investigate the cause of the storage error, and retry.

 

Module:  DFH0CBAE,DFH0CBRE,DFH0CBRF

 

ABX2

 

Explanation:  The bridge exit or formatter was called with an invalid BRXA-TRANSACTION-AREA.  This indicates a storage overwrite.

 

System Action:  An exception trace is made of the data in error. The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

As CICS also does a check of the BRXA on return from the call to the exit, there will probably be a subsequent ABRZ abend.

 

User Response:  Investigate the cause of the storage error, and retry.

 

Module:  DFH0CBAE,DFH0CBRE,DFH0CBRF

 

ABX3

 

Explanation:  The bridge exit or formatter was called with an invalid BRXA-COMMAND-AREA.  This indicates a storage overwrite.

User Response:  Investigate the cause of the storage error, and retry.

 

Module:  DFH0CBAE,DFH0CBRE,DFH0CBRF

 

ABX7

 

Explanation:  A TC command passed to the formatter, exceeded the maximum message size.

 

System Action:  An exception trace is made of the first 4K of data in error. The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Check that the user transaction is passing the correct data. If it is, it will be necessary to change the size of the buffer. This is in field 

block-length in the sample exit. Recompile and reload the exit and retry.

 

Module:  DFH0CBRF

 

ABX8

 

Explanation:  A next BMS BRMQ vector in the input message passed to the formatter does not contain the mapset requested to answer a RECEIVE MAP 

request.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  This may just indicate that the transaction has gone down an error path which should result in a transaction backout. If not, the input 

message should have a BRMQ vector for this mapset. Change the client application, recompile and retry.

 

Module:  DFH0CBRF

 

ABX9

 

Explanation:  A next BMS BRMQ vector in the input message passed to the formatter does not contain the mapname requested to answer a RECEIVE 

MAP request.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  This may just indicate that the transaction has gone down an error path which should result in a transaction backout. If not, the input 

message should have a BRMQ vector for this mapname. Change the client application, recompile and retry.

 

Module:  DFH0CBRF 

 

ACAA

 

Explanation:  This explanation applies to the two transaction abend codes, ACAA and ACAD.  CICS cannot find a match for a function code in the language 

definition table because the parameterized resource definition contains an unrecognized resource type code. The abend code issued depends on the 

DFHCAP operation that was invoked before the error occurred:

 

Abend   DFHCAP operation

ACAA    ANALYZE

ACAD    DEFAULTS

 

The cause of the abend is either:

 


   The language definition table, DFHEITCU, in the library is invalid for the release of CICS you are running, or


   A CICS logic error has occurred.

 

 

System Action:

 


   In a CICS environment, the CEDA transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 


   In a batch environment, processing is abnormally terminated with an operating system dump.

 

 

User Response:  Ensure that the DFHEITCU module is in the library and is valid for this release of CICS.

 

If a valid version of DFHEITCU is already in the library, a CICS logic error has occurred. You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See 

Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to proceed.

ACFA

 

Explanation:  During the loading of a Coupling Facility Data Table by the CFCL transaction, an abend was detected or a domain call returned a response 

(such as DISASTER) after which normal processing could not continue.

 

System Action:  A message is issued (one of DFHFC7100, DFHFC7101, DFHFC7103 or DFHFC7104).  Loading of the data table is terminated and CFCL 

abends.

 

User Response:  If this abend is produced as a result of an abend during loading, message DFHFC7103 is issued. If it is a result of a domain call failure, 

depending on which domain the failure was returned by, one of the messages DFHFC7100, DFHFC7101 or DFHFC7104 is issued. Refer to the description of 

the message for further information and guidance.

 

Module:  DFHFCDL

 

ACFB

 

Explanation:  A transaction has issued a request to a coupling facility data table for which it holds an active lock, but after the lock was acquired, the 

coupling facility data table server for the pool in which this coupling facility data table resides failed and was restarted. This request is of a type which cannot 

continue against a new instance of the server, because it is reliant on the lock which was acquired before the server failed.

 

System Action:  The requesting transaction abends with a transaction dump.

 

CICS continues normally.

 

User Response:  Retry the failed transaction.

 

Module:  DFHEIFC

 

ACFC

 

Explanation:  A transaction has issued a request to a coupling facility data table which was last accessed using a previous instance of the coupling facility 

data table server (that is, the server for the pool in which this coupling facility data table resides has failed and been restarted one or more times since the 

last access). We therefore need to reopen the access between this CICS file and the coupling facility data table, but the attempt to reopen access has failed.

 

System Action:  The requesting transaction abends with a transaction dump.

 

CICS continues normally.

 

User Response:  Retry the failed transaction. If the error continues to occur, issue an explicit close request for the file, followed by an explicit open request.

 

Module:  DFHEIFC

 

ACFD

 

Explanation:  During the loading of a Coupling Facility Data Table by the CFCL transaction, a call to the CICS Transaction Manager has returned a response 

(such as DISASTER) after which normal processing could not continue.

 

System Action:  Message DFHFC7121 is issued. Loading of the data table is terminated and CFCL abends.

 

User Response:  Refer to the description of the message for further information and guidance.

 

Module:  DFHFCDL

 

ACFE

 

Explanation:  An attempt was made to attach a transaction specifying DFHFCDL as the program to be given control, but the transaction was not internally 

attached by CICS.

 

DFHFCDL is for use by CICS system transaction CFCL. This loads a Coupling Facility Data Table.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated. CICS processing continues.

 

User Response:  Establish why an attempt was made to attach CFCL illegally, or why a transaction definition specified DFHFCDL as the program to be 

given control.

 

Module:  DFHFCDL

 

ACHA

 

Explanation:  The remote server transaction, CEHS, is not at a compatible level to operate with the CICS/CMS system. This usually indicates that the 

service levels of CICS/CMS and the remote server are different.

 

Problem Determination:  To diagnose a problem with the remote server, it is generally helpful to obtain a trace of the remote server's activity up to the point 

of failure.

 

A remote server trace is obtained by invoking the remote server with the TRACE option, (type CEHS TRACE). The remote server operates as normal but 

causes entries to be written to a trace log in temporary storage. Note that main storage, not auxiliary, is used for this queue hence large amounts of memory 

can be used up if this trace is left on for long.

 

The trace is found in a queue whose name is 'CEHSxxxx', where 'xxxx' is the four-character terminal identifier. The queue can be browsed in text form or in 

hexadecimal form using CEBR. To find the terminal identifier, invoke CEBR on the terminal that has run CEHS, without giving a queue name. The queue 

name will default to 'CEBRxxxx', where 'xxxx' is the terminal identifier.

 

Note: CEBR requires the queue name to be in UPPER CASE.

 

For a description of the remote server and its trace entries and abend codes, see the CICS/VS Remote Server Diagnosis Manual (LC33-0438).

 

System Action:  CICS terminates the remote server transaction abnormally with a dump.

 

User Response:  You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to 

proceed.

 

Module:  DFHCHS

 

ACHB

 

Explanation:  The remote server has received a data frame from CICS/CMS that is out of sequence. A frame may have been lost in transmission.

 

System Action:  CICS terminates the remote server abnormally with a dump.

 

User Response:  Reestablish the connection between CICS/CMS and the remote CICS system and try to use the remote server again. For further 

information, see the 'Problem Determination' section for abend code ACHA.

 

If the problem persists, you will need assistance from IBM to resolve the problem. You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 

of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to proceed.

 

Module:  DFHCHS

User Response:  Use the transaction dump to determine whether the problem is caused by the return code or the response. If terminal control was unable to 

process the request, the abend may occur when:

 


   The program in the connected region terminates abnormally. In this case, determine the reason why the program has abnormally terminated.

 


   The session has failed.

 

 

Otherwise the distributed application programs may have violated APPC conversation protocols.

 

Module:  DFHZXRT

 

ACVP

 

Explanation:  The transaction routing program in the terminal-owning region did not receive an FMH43 from the application-owning region. This violates CICS 

transaction routing protocols.

 

The trace from the application-owning region will show its response to the terminal-owning region.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a transaction dump and an exception trace entry.

 

User Response:  You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to 

proceed.

 

Module:  DFHZXRT

 

ACVQ

 

Explanation:  The transaction routing program in the terminal-owning region issued a request to the APPC terminal, and received a nonzero return code from 

terminal control.

 

Both the request and the return code are located in the DFHLUC parameter list which is printed in the exception trace.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a transaction dump and an exception trace entry.

 

User Response:  Use the transaction dump to determine why terminal control was unable to process the request. The terminal session may have failed or be 

in the wrong state, for example, as the result of both the terminal and application issuing SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK at the same time.

 

Module:  DFHZXRT

 

ACVR

 

Explanation:  The transaction routing program in the terminal-owning region issued a SEND,LAST,WAIT request to the LU 6.2 terminal, and received a 

nonzero return code from terminal control.

 

The return code is located in the DFHLUC parameter list which is printed in the exception trace.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a transaction dump and an exception trace entry.

 

User Response:  Use the transaction dump to determine why terminal control was unable to process the request. The terminal session may have failed.

 

Module:  DFHZXRT

 

ACWA

 

Explanation:  CICS CWTO transaction has failed because the task does not own a terminal (TCTTE) as its principal facility. This has probably happened 

because CWTO has been started as an EXEC CICS START transid without a terminal ID.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated without a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Retry with a terminal ID value or enter CWTO from a terminal.

 

Module:  DFHCWTO

 

ACXA

 

Explanation:  The catch-up transaction, CXCU, has failed. CXCU runs either in response to a transaction request from an end-user, or is run automatically 

by an active CICS system in response to the appearance of an alternative CICS system. Its purpose is to inform the alternate system of the active system's 

state regarding terminals and DBCTL connection.

 

System Action:  The catch-up transaction, CXCU, is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. Both active and alternate CICS systems 

continue, but the alternate CICS system is less effective in the event of a takeover. For example, terminal back-up sessions may not be established. This 

abend is accompanied by DFHDX8313.

 

User Response:  Retry by entering 'CXCU' from a terminal. If the error persists, diagnose the problem from the dump.

 

Module:  DFHCXCU

 

  

ADCA

 

Explanation:  This abend is issued if DBCTL returns a non-zero response code when a DL/I request has been issued from an application program.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Look up accompanying message DFHDB8109 that appears on the CDBC transient data destination.

 

Module:  DFHDLIDP

 

ADCB

 

Explanation:  This abend occurs when DBCTL has notified CICS that a task has issued a DL/I request, but it did not have a PSB scheduled. If your 

application does have a PSB scheduled then a possible cause for this abend is that the DBCTL STOP THREAD command may have been used to terminate 

the DBCTL thread that corresponds to this task.

 

System Action:  CICS abnormally terminates the transaction with a transaction dump. CICS processing continues.

 

User Response:  Check if the DBCTL operator has issued a STOP THREAD command for the task that has abnormally terminated. Look up DBCTL 

response code 28 in the DBCTL return code section of the IMS Messages and Codes manual.

 

Module:  DFHDLIDP

 

ADCC

 

Explanation:  This abend occurs when DBCTL has notified CICS that a task has issued program specification block (PSB) request, but it has a PSB 

already scheduled. CICS prevents a task from issuing a PSB schedule request to DBCTL when it has already issued a PSB schedule request by returning a 

PSBSCH response in UIBDLTR. However, in this case it is DBCTL that has rejected the subsequent PSB schedule request. A possible cause for this abend 

is a storage over-write.

 

System Action:  CICS abnormally terminates the transaction with a transaction dump. CICS processing continues.

 

User Response:  Check for any messages issued from your CICS system indicating that storage over-writes have taken place. Look up DBCTL response 

code 32 in the DBCTL return code section of the IMS Messages and Codes manual.

 

Module:  DFHDLIDP

 

ADCD

 

Explanation:  This abend is issued when a deadlock has been detected by IMS and this transaction has been selected for abnormal termination.

 

This abend can occur when a transaction is accessing IMS resources via DBCTL or via a remote DLI request to a remote CICS region. The remote CICS 

region can be accessing IMS via DBCTL, or if it is a CICS 4.1 region or earlier, accessing IMS via local DLI.

 

System Action:  Access to IMS resources via DBCTL is withdrawn for this transaction. Further attempts to access IMS will result in an AEY9 abend.

 

CICS abnormally terminates the transaction with a transaction dump. CICS processing continues.

 

User Response:  If ADCD abends occur infrequently in your system, no action is required although you may like to consider setting your system up in such 

a way that, after an ADCD abend is issued, the transaction is automatically restarted. See the CICS Recovery and Restart Guide for further information.

 

If ADCD abends are occurring frequently in your system, you may need to review the design of your applications. Some general techniques for deadlock 

avoidance are described in the CICS Recovery and Restart Guide.

 

Module:  DFHDLIDP

 

ADCE

 

Explanation:  This abend is issued when the module DFHDBAT returns a nonzero return code in reply to a DL/I request issued from an application program 

to DBCTL. DFHDBAT is a task related user exit and forms part of the CICS-DBCTL interface. This abend is accompanied by message DFHDB8110.

 

System Action:  CICS abnormally terminates the transaction with a transaction dump. CICS processing continues.

 

User Response:  Look up the accompanying message DFHDB8110 that appears on the CDBC transient data destination.

 

Module:  DFHDLIDP

 

ADCI

 

Explanation:  This abend is issued when IMS returns a user abend 3303 response for a DL/I request issued from an application program.

 

System Action:  Access to IMS resources via DBCTL is withdrawn for this transaction. Further attempts to access IMS will result in an AEY9 abend.

 

CICS abnormally terminates the transaction with a transaction dump. CICS processing continues.

 

User Response:  Check the description in the IMS Messages and Codes manual for the meaning of IMS user abend 3303.

 

Module:  DFHDLIDP

 

ADCJ

 

Explanation:  This abend is issued when an application has been using DBCTL, and while the application was still scheduled to DBCTL, the CICS-DBCTL 

interface was terminated.

 

System Action:  CICS abnormally terminates the transaction with a transaction dump. CICS processing continues.

 

User Response:  Check the CDBC transient data destination for messages indicating the reason for termination of the CICS-DBCTL interface. If you do not 

know where the CDBC transient is, then please check with your system programmer. Check for messages issued from the DBCTL system.

 

Module:  DFHDLIDP

 

ADCP

 

Explanation:  When checking the DBCTL program specification block (PSB), the external security manager checked the usage of the PSB, and found that:

 


   The user was unauthorized to access the PSB, or

 


   The PSB was unknown to the external security manager, or

 


   The user was set to the capability of the default user.

 

 

The meaning of the term "user" in the above context depends on the way the transaction was invoked.

 


   If the transaction is being run from a local terminal, or has been routed from a remote terminal, the user is the terminal user. (For a routed transaction, if 

 

    PSBCHK=NO is specified in the SIT, or RESSEC=NO is specified in the transaction definition (CEDA DEFINE TRANSACTION command), the security 

    manager does not check the terminal user.)

 


   If the transaction is being run as a result of a request from another CICS MRO region, the user is the owner of the other CICS system (as defined to the 

 

    external security manager in the JOB statement of the initializing JCL).

 


   If the transaction is being run as a result of a request from a connected ISC system, the user is defined in the SECURITYNAME operand of the installed 

 

    CONNECTION definition that defines the link between the remote system and the local system. Ensure that the name in the SECURITYNAME operand is 

    the same as that supplied by the connected CICS system. This will depend upon the type of CONNECTION between the two systems. For further 

    information about this, refer to the CICS Intercommunication Guide.

 

 

Notes.

 

By the above definitions, a PSB used by a routed transaction has two users, the terminal user and the communicating region. Therefore, for routed 

transactions, the external security manager makes two checks, on the terminal user (as qualified in 1 above), and on the communicating region (2 or 3 

above).

 

System Action:  CICS abnormally terminates the task attempting to schedule the PSB. CICS processing continues.

 

User Response:  Ensure that the PSB is defined to the external security manager, and that all users have the correct level of authorization. If the system 

setup is correct, note the security violation.

 

Module:  DFHDLIDP

 

ADCQ

 

Explanation:  This abend occurs when an application has issued an EXEC DLI SCHD request for a PSB that contains no DBPCBs, and the SYSSERVE 

keyword was not specified.  This abend also occurs when an application has issued a PCB request for a PSB that contains no DBPCBs, and the IOPCB 

option was not specified.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Check that the application program has scheduled the appropriate PSB.

 

Module:  DFHDLIDP

 

ADCR

 

Explanation:  This abend occurs when an application has issued a DL/I request other than a schedule request, and the DBCTL DRA return code of 40 

indicates that there was no active communication with DBCTL.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Check the CDBC transient data destination for messages indicating the reason for termination of the CICS-DBCTL interface. If you do not 

know where the CDBC transient data destination is, check with your system programmer. Check for messages issued from the DBCTL system.

 

Module:  DFHDLIDP

 

ADCS

 

Explanation:  CICS issued a single-phase commit request to DBCTL and an unexpected response was returned from DBCTL.

 

System Action:  CICS issues message DFHDB8119 to transient data queue CDBC, then terminates the task abnormally with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Message DFHDB8119 shows the unexpected response from DBCTL, along with the recovery token of the LUW involved. The explanation of 

message DFHDB8119 indicates how the outcome of the LUW can be determined.

 

Module:  DFHDBAT

 

ADCT

 

Explanation:  A user has attempted to invoke the CICS-DBCTL control transaction from a terminal.

 

System Action:  CICS rejects the request.

 

User Response:  Do not try to invoke CICS internal transactions directly.

 

Module:  DFHDBCT

 

ADCV

 

Explanation:  The connection to DBCTL was terminated and then re-established. The failing task had issued a schedule request against an earlier run of 

DBCTL and is therefore no longer scheduled.

 

System Action:  CICS abnormally terminates the transaction with a transaction dump. CICS processing continues.

 

User Response:  No action is required, although you may like to consider setting your system up in such a way that, after an abend ADCV is issued, the 

transaction is automatically restarted.

 

Module:  DFHDLIDP

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Ensure that any errors in the DL/I argument are corrected.

 

Module:  DFHDLIRP

 

ADLP

 

Explanation:  When checking the DLI program specification block (PSB), the external security manager checked the usage of the PSB, and found that:

 


   The user was unauthorized to access the PSB, or

 


   The PSB was unknown to the external security manager, or

 


   The user was set to the capability of the default user.

 

 

The meaning of the term "user" in the above context depends on the way the transaction was invoked.

 


   If the transaction is being run from a local terminal, or has been routed from a remote terminal, the user is the terminal user. (For a routed transaction, if 

 

    PSBCHK=NO is specified in the SIT, or RESSEC=NO is specified in the transaction definition (CEDA DEFINE TRANSACTION command), the security 

    manager does not check the terminal user.)

 


   If the transaction is being run as a result of a request from another CICS MRO region, the user is the owner of the other CICS system (as defined to the 

 

    external security manager in the JOB statement of the initializing JCL).

 


   If the transaction is being run as a result of a request from a connected ISC system, the user is defined in the SECURITYNAME operand of the installed 

 

    CONNECTION definition that defines the link between the remote system and the local system. Ensure that the name in the SECURITYNAME operand is 

    the same as that supplied by the connected CICS system. This will depend upon the type of CONNECTION between the two systems. For further 

    information about this, refer to the CICS Intercommunication Guide.

 

 

Note:  By the above definitions, a PSB used by a routed transaction has two users, the terminal user and the communicating region. Therefore, for routed 

       transactions, the external security manager makes two checks, on the terminal user (as qualified in 1 above), and on the communicating region (2 or 3 

       above).

 

System Action:  The task attempting to schedule the PSB abnormally terminates.

 

User Response:  Ensure that the PSB is defined to the external security manager, and that all users have the correct level of authorization. If the system 

setup is correct, note the security violation.

 

Module:  DFHDLIRP

AD2P

 

Explanation:  The transaction was unable to obtain a DB2 thread from a DB2ENTRY or the pool.  See the associated transient data message DFHDB2011 

to determine which DB2ENTRY was involved or whether it was the pool. The transaction was abended because the DB2ENTRY or the pool specified 

threadwait(no) meaning do not wait for a thread if all threads are currently in use. Note if message DFHDB2011 indicates that the pool was being used, it 

means the transaction was using the pool directly rather than overflowing to the pool. (An abend AD3T is produced when a transaction overflows to the pool 

and no pool threads are available.)

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Determine whether more threads should be allocated to the DB2ENTRY or the pool, or whether the number of instances of this transaction 

should be limited using TRANCLASS.

 

Module:  DFHD2EX1

 

AD2Q

 

Explanation:  An error (INVALID, DISASTER or unexpected EXCEPTION response) has occurred on an getmain call to the storage manager (SM) domain.

AD2R

 

Explanation:  The CICS-DB2 thread TCB processing the DB2 request for this transaction has abended. An exception trace (AP 319D) is written containing 

the MVS abend code and reason code as well as the relevant CICS-DB2 control blocks used by the CICS task and the CICS-DB2 thread TCB. In particular 

the CSUB control block contains data from the MVS SDWA at the time of the abend, for example fields CSB_SDWA_REGS (regs 0 -15) and 

CSB_SDWA_PSW.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Examine the trace in the CICS transaction dump to determine why the CICS-DB2 thread TCB abended.

 

Module:  DFHD2EX1

 

AD2S

 

Explanation:  The thread TCB servicing the DB2 request for the transaction issued a sign-on request to DB2 which failed. The installed DB2CONN specifies 

THREADERROR(N906D) or THREADERROR(ABEND).

 

System Action:

 

If THREADERROR(N906D) is specified in the DB2CONN, processing continues. A -906 sqlcode is returned to the application, and a transaction dump is 

taken with abend code AD2S.

 

If THREADERROR(ABEND) is specified in the DB2CONN, the task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Examine the AUTHID or AUTHTYPE parameter of the DB2ENTRY or pool used for the transaction. Ensure the id is authorised to access 

the plan in DB2.

 

Module:  DFHD2EX1

 

AD2T

 

Explanation:  An attempt to create a DB2 thread by the TCB servicing the DB2 request for the transaction failed with DB2 reason code 00F30040. The 

installed DB2CONN specifies THREADERROR(N906D) or THREADERROR(ABEND).

 

System Action:

 

If THREADERROR(N906D) is specified in the DB2CONN, processing continues. A -906 sqlcode is returned to the application and a transaction dump is 

taken with abend code AD2T.

 

If THREADERROR(ABEND) is specified in the DB2CONN, the task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Either the plan is unavailable or is not known to DB2.

 

Module:  DFHD2EX1

 

AD2U

 

Explanation:  An attempt to create a DB2 thread by the TCB servicing the DB2 request failed.  The installed DB2CONN specifies THREADERROR(N906D) 

or THREADERROR(ABEND).

 

System Action:

 

If THREADERROR(N906D) is specified in the DB2CONN, processing continues. A -906 sqlcode is returned to the application and a transaction dump is 

taken with abend code AD2U.

 

If THREADERROR(ABEND) is specified in the DB2CONN, the task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Examine the dump to determine why the create thread failed.

 

Module:  DFHD2EX1

 

AD2V

 

Explanation:  The CICS-DB2 attachment facility issued a commit or abort request to DB2 but received a reason code 00F30805 indicating that connection 

to DB2 has been lost. This is due to DB2 terminating abnormally or being in the process of terminating abnormally. If the commit or abort request was 

preceded by a prepare request, DB2 may well still be indoubt. In this case, the CICS-DB2 attachment facility instructs CICS to remember the outcome of the 

UOW pending resynchronisation, which will happen when CICS and DB2 are reconnected. For an abort request not preceded by a prepare, i.e. a transaction 

abend or syncpoint rollback, DB2 will not be indoubt as the UOW was still inflight. DB2 will backout updates made by the UOW when restarted so there is no 

need for CICS to remember the outcome of the UOW.

 

System Action:  The transaction completes normally but a transaction dump is taken with abend code AD2V. If DB2 is indoubt about the outcome of the 

UOW it will be resolved when CICS and DB2 are reconnected.

 

User Response:  Contact your system programmer to restart the DB2 subsystem.

 

Module:  DFHD2EX1

 

AD2W

 

Explanation:  The CICS-DB2 attachment facility issued a single-phase commit call to DB2 but received an unexpected response. Transient data message 

DFHDB2055 details the DB2 reason code received. The commit request may have been processed or it may have been ended. There is no resynchronisation 

needed, as no CICS recoverable resources were updated.

 

System Action:  The CICS-DB2 attachment facility abnormally terminates the transaction with abend code AD2W. The CICS recovery manager will 

supersede the AD2W abend code with abend code ASPR. A transaction dump is taken.

 

User Response:  You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to 

proceed.

 

Module:  DFHD2EX1

 

AD2X

 

Explanation:  The CICS-DB2 attachment facility detected that the CICS task and the thread TCB were in an invalid state. A console message is output, an 

exception trace written and, possibly, a system dump taken (depending on the options specified in the dump table).

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to 

proceed.

 

Module:  DFHD2EX1

 

AD2Y

 

Explanation:  The transaction was unable to obtain a DB2 thread from a DB2ENTRY or the pool because there were no TCBs available on which to create 

the thread. The number of thread TCBs currently running is at the TCBLIMIT defined in the DB2CONN.  Message DFHDB2010 is output to transient data. The 

transaction was abended because either:

 


   The DB2ENTRY specifies threadwait(no), meaning do not wait for a thread, including having to wait to create a thread because a TCB is not available - 

 

    that is, do not wait for a TCB either.

 


   The DB2ENTRY specified threadwait(pool), but the pool definition within the DB2CONN specifies threadwait(no), and again there were no TCBs available.

 

 


   The transaction was using the pool directly, the pool specifies threadwait(no) and no TCB was available.

 

 

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Determine whether TCBLIMIT should be increased or whether the number of transactions using DB2 at any one instance should be limited 

using transaction classes.

 

Module:  DFHD2EX1

 

AD2Z

 

Explanation:  DB2 detected a deadlock and the CICS-DB2 attachment facility attempted a syncpoint rollback command for the transaction as 

DROLLBACK(YES) was specified for the DB2ENTRY or POOL. The syncpoint rollback command failed. Message DFHDB2070 is output to transient data 

detailing the transid involved and the EIBRESP2 from the failed syncpoint rollback command.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Examine the eibresp2 value to determine why the syncpoint rollback request failed. One possible reason could be that the transaction 

running is a DPL server transaction which was DPLed to by a client transaction without specifying the SYNCONRETURN parameter. In this case syncpoints, 

or syncpoint rollbacks, cannot be taken by the server transaction, so DROLLBACK(YES) is invalid in this case.

 

Module:  DFHD2EX1

 

AD21

 

Explanation:  The CICS-DB2 attachment facility received a request for a resource manager with the incorrect name. Message DFHDB2045 is output to

AEIA

 

Note: The description of this abend also applies to AEID to AEI9, AEXC, AEXF, AEXG, AEXI to AEXL, AEXV to AEXX, AEX0 to AEX9, AEYA to AEYC, 

AEYE to AEY3, AEY7, and AEZE to AEZQ.

 

Explanation:  The EXEC interface program issues an abend when an exceptional condition has occurred but the command does not have the RESP option 

(or NOHANDLE option), or the application program has not executed an EXEC CICS HANDLE CONDITION command for that condition. This will cause 

DFHEIP to take the system action for the condition in question. In most cases, the system action will be to abend the transaction.

 

Problem Determination:  The function code of the command that produced the exceptional response and the response code can be found in the EXEC 

interface block (EIB). The EIB is part of a larger control block, used by DFHEIP, known as the EXEC interface storage block (EIS). The EIS is addressed by 

the TCAEISA, which is the system part of the TCA + X'90' The EIB is pointed to from the EIS + X'8'.

 

The function code may be located at offset X'1B' in the EIB while the response codes may be one of the following at the given offsets:

 

 

EIBRCODE       X'1D'

 

EIBRESP        X'4C'

 

EIBRESP2       X'50'

 

 

The CICS Application Programming Reference gives translations of the encoded functions and their responses.

 

Analysis: Because these abend codes are directly related to exceptional conditions that can be specified in HANDLE CONDITION commands, the 

application programmer should decide whether the condition is one that should be handled by the application (for example ENDFILE), or one that requires 

modifications to the application or CICS tables.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Change the application program either to prevent the condition recurring, to check it by using the RESP option, or to handle the condition 

when it does occur (by using the EXEC CICS HANDLE CONDITION command). If necessary, use the contents of the EIBRESP2 field or the EIBRCODE in 

the EIB to assist in determining the cause of the exceptional condition.

AELA

 

Explanation:  The executing function has been purged before control could be returned.

 

System Action:  The transaction is marked to be abnormally terminated with abend code AELA.

 

User Response:  Investigate the reason the task was purged. It was purged either by the master terminal operator, or as a result of a deadlock timeout.

 

If the task was purged by the master terminal operator, this may have been in an attempt to clear the system which appeared to be deadlocked for some 

reason.

 

If the task was timed out automatically as a result of the DTIMOUT value being exceeded, this may be due to insufficient main storage being available for the 

number of tasks in the system. If the amount of main storage cannot be increased then the number of tasks in the system should be reduced to avoid 

short-on-storage situations. Another possibility would be to increase the value of the DTIMOUT option for the transaction.

 

Module:  DFHETL

 

AELB

 

Explanation:  The executing function has been purged before control could be returned.

 

System Action:  The transaction is marked to be abnormally terminated with abend code AELB.

 

User Response:  Investigate the reason the task was purged. It was purged either by the master terminal operator, or as a result of a deadlock timeout.

 

If the task was purged by the master terminal operator, this may have been in an attempt to clear the system which appeared to be deadlocked for some 

reason.

 

If the task was timed out automatically as a result of the DTIMOUT value being exceeded, this may be due to insufficient main storage being available for the 

number of tasks in the system. If the amount of main storage cannot be increased then the number of tasks in the system should be reduced to avoid 

short-on-storage situations. Another possibility would be to increase the value of the DTIMOUT option for the transaction.

AEMA

 

Explanation:  An error (INVALID or DISASTER response) has occurred on a call to the application (AP) domain when a request for set user exit active could 

not be serviced.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated. The domain that detected the original error issues a console message and might provide an exception 

trace, and depending on the options specified in the dump table, a system dump.

 

User Response:  See the associated console message for further guidance.

 

Module:  DFHUEM

 

AEMB

 

Explanation:  An error (INVALID or DISASTER response) has occurred on a call to the loader (LD) domain. The domain that detected the original error will 

have provided an exception trace, a console message, and possibly a system dump (depending on the options in the dump table).

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump (depending on the options in the dump table).

 

User Response:  See the related message from the domain that detected the original error.

 

Module:  DFHUEM

 

AEMP

 

Explanation:  The task was purged before a set active request to the application (AP) domain was able to complete successfully. The domain that first 

detected the purged condition may provide an exception trace.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Investigate why the task was purged. This is either as a result of a purge from the master terminal operator via the CEMT transaction, or by 

the task being timed out after waiting for longer than the DTIMOUT (deadlock timeout) value specified for the transaction.

 

If the master terminal operator purged the task, this may have been in an attempt to clear the system which appeared to be deadlocked for some reason.

 

If the task was timed out automatically as a result of the DTIMOUT value being exceeded, this may be due to insufficient main storage being available for the 

number of tasks in the system. If the amount of main storage cannot be increased, reduce the number of tasks in the system to avoid short-on-storage 

situations. Another possibility is to increase the value of the DTIMOUT option for the transaction.

 

Module:  DFHUEM

 

AEMQ

 

Explanation:  The task was purged before an IDENTIFY_PROGRAM request to the loader (LD) domain was able to complete successfully. The domain that 

first detected the purged condition provides an exception trace.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump (depending on the options in the dump table).

 

User Response:  Investigate why the task was purged. This is either as a result of a purge from the master terminal operator via the CEMT transaction, or by 

the task being timed out after waiting for longer than the DTIMOUT (deadlock timeout) value specified for the transaction.

 

If the master terminal operator purged the task, this may have been in an attempt to clear the system which appeared to be deadlocked for some reason.

 

If the task was timed out automatically as a result of the DTIMOUT value being exceeded, this may be due to insufficient main storage being available for the 

number of tasks in the system. If the amount of main storage cannot be increased, reduce the number of tasks in the system to avoid short-on-storage

AETA

 

Explanation:  A CICS transaction has issued a non-CICS command via an application "stub" (an expansion of a DFHRMCAL macro). Program DFHERM has 

determined that the exit has been disabled since the previous DFHRMCAL request was issued from the transaction.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a transaction dump

 

User Response:  Notify your system programmer.

AETC

 

Explanation:  A CICS transaction has issued a non-CICS command via an application "stub" (an expansion of a DFHRMCAL macro). However, the 

task-related user exit (TRUE) is not known to program manager.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a transaction dump

 

User Response:  Ensure that the TRUE as identified to the DFHRMCAL macro has been correctly defined to CICS.

AETF

 

Explanation:  The task was purged before a request to the storage manager (SM) domain was able to complete successfully. The domain that first detected 

the purged condition will have provided an exception trace.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Investigate why the task was purged. This is either as a result of a purge from the master terminal operator via the CEMT transaction, or by 

the task being timed out after waiting for longer than the DTIMOUT (deadlock timeout) value specified for the transaction.

 

If the master terminal operator purged the task, this may have been in an attempt to clear the system which appeared to be deadlocked for some reason.

 

If the task was timed out automatically as a result of the DTIMOUT value being exceeded, this may be due to insufficient main storage being available for the 

number of tasks in the system. If the amount of main storage cannot be increased, reduce the number of tasks in the system to avoid short-on-storage 

situations. Another possibility is to increase the value of the DTIMOUT option for the transaction.

points to the storage area at fault.

 

Change one or more of the following:

 


   Correct the code in error in the transaction issuing the EXEC CICS command in order to supply a valid storage area.

 

 


   If storage protection is active, change the EXECKEY on the CEDA definition for the program that issued the EXEC CICS command from USER to CICS.

 

 


   If storage protection is active, change the TASKDATAKEY attributes on the transaction definition from CICS to USER.

program block indicates there should be more associations (for example, the activation count has not been reduced to zero). The user exit table and 

associated control blocks (EPBs and EPLs) are out of step and have probably been corrupted.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to 

proceed.

AEY9

 

Explanation:  One of the following:

 


   An EXEC CICS command has been issued that is not supported by the EXEC interface program DFHEIP.

 

 


   A transaction has issued an EXEC CICS command which is supported in principle by the EXEC interface program DFHEIP, but for which the prerequisite 

 

    function has not been included in the current CICS start-up.

 


   A non-CICS command has been issued via an application "stub" (expansion of a DFHRMCAL macro), and the program DFHERM has detected that the 

 

    necessary non-CICS support is not available.

 


   An attempt has been made to use remote resources, but the local SYSID has been specified in an EXEC CICS command, or vice versa.

 

 


   An attempt has been made to use remote resources, but ISC is not supported.

 

 


   An EXEC CICS command contains an invalid AID or CONDITION identifier. This indicates that the EXEC CICS command has become corrupted.

 

 

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Check that the sysid specified and the resource names were correct. If not, notify the system programmer. Either the command (or an 

application stub) has become corrupted, or the unavailable function needs to be generated (CICS command), ENABLEd (non-CICS command), or 

exceptionally the non-CICS support has suffered damage and is attempting to withdraw itself from the CICS system.

AEZA

 

Explanation:  A transaction has been defined with a TASKDATALOC(ANY), but the programs within the transaction are running amode 24. The exec 

interface program is therefore is unable to access the TCA for the application. Furthermore, any reference to the EIB would cause the transaction to fail with 

an OC4 protection exception.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated.

 

 

Module:  DFHEIP

 

AEZB

 

Explanation:  A transaction has been defined with a TASKDATALOC(ANY), and the application is attempting to call a task related user exit. However the 

task related user exit has been linkedited AMODE 24 and enabled with the LINKEDITMODE option, thereby directing CICS to invoke it in AMODE 24. An 

AMODE 24 task related user exit cannot run when the calling application is running with TASKDATALOC(ANY), as this would cause a protection exception, 

or a storage overwrite.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated.

 

User Response:  Either redefine and install a new definition for the transaction with TASKDATALOC(BELOW), or modify the task related user exit so that it 

is invoked in AMODE 31.

 

Module:  DFHERM

 

AEZC

 

Explanation:  A transaction has been defined with a TASKDATALOC(ANY), but a program within the transaction is defined to run AMODE 24. CICS cannot 

invoke the AMODE 24 program when the transaction is running with TASKDATALOC(ANY), as this would cause a protection exception, or a storage 

overwrite.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated.

 

User Response:  Either redefine and install a new definition for the transaction with TASKDATALOC(BELOW), or relink the program as AMODE 31.

 

Module:  DFHAPLI

 

AEZD

 

Explanation:  An attempt has been made to run a program defined as EXECKEY(USER) as part of a transaction defined as TASKDATAKEY(CICS). These 

attributes are incompatible and the transaction is abended. This incompatibility could occur as a result of the program definition being autoinstalled. See the 

CICS Customization Guide and the CICS Resource Definition Guide for more information about program autoinstall.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated.

 

User Response:  Redefine and install a new definition either for the transaction with TASKDATAKEY(USER), or for the program with EXECKEY(CICS).

 

If this abend occurs when running a CICS transaction, a possible cause is that you are not using the CICS-supplied definition for the program. If you are using 

your own copies of CICS-supplied program definitions, they must be defined as EXECKEY(CICS).

AFCF

 

Explanation:  A deadlock has been detected between two or more tasks issuing file control requests.

 

System Action:  The task that would have entered deadlock is abended with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Examine this transaction and other transactions in the system that update the same files to find the cause of the deadlock, then correct 

the error.

 

When transactions update several files within the same unit of work, all transactions should update these files in the same order. A transaction that abends 

AFCF may be retried by specifying RESTART(YES) in the transaction definition and by coding a suitable DFHREST program.

 

Modules: DFHEIFC, DFHDMPCA

 

AFCG

 

Explanation:  A transaction has issued a sequence of file control requests that would cause the file to deadlock itself. This response arises for different 

reasons depending upon the file type.

 

If the file is being accessed in non-RLS mode, the response is caused by the transaction making conflicting requests against the same CI. For example, if 

the file is being accessed using LSR, a self deadlock will arise when an attempt is made to read a record that is in the same CI as a record that is the 

subject of a READ UPDATE or WRITE MASSINSERT request issued by the same transaction.

 

If the file is accessed in RLS mode there is no CI locking, but self deadlock responses can still arise. They are caused by sequences of requests that are 

either logically meaningless or which cannot be performed by VSAM RLS.

 

With VSAM RLS the most likely causes of this abend are as follows:

 


   Two successive READ UPDATE requests against the same record by the same transaction without an intervening REWRITE, DELETE or UNLOCK 

 

    command.

 

    This is an incorrect use of file control requests.

 


   A transaction has created a record by WRITE MASSINSERT and then, without terminating the WRITE MASSINSERT sequence by issuing an UNLOCK 

 

    request, the same transaction has attempted to modify the same record by issuing a READ UPDATE or DELETE request.

 

    This sequence of requests fails if VSAM has not written the record out to disk. The only way to guarantee that the record has been written to disk is to 

    issue the UNLOCK request.

 


   A transaction has updated or deleted a record using a browse for update sequence and then, without terminating the browse for update sequence by 

 

    issuing an ENDBR request, the same transaction has attempted to modify the same record by issuing a separate READ UPDATE or DELETE or WRITE 

    request.

 

    This sequence of requests fails if VSAM has not written the record out to disk. The only way to guarantee that the record has been written to disk is to 

    issue the ENDBR request.

 

 

If the file is used to access a coupling facility data table, then self deadlock responses are caused by sequences of requests that are either logically 

meaningless or which cannot be performed by coupling facility data tables support.

 

For coupling facility data tables, the most likely cause of this abend is as follows:

 


   Two successive READ UPDATE requests have been issued against the same record by the same transaction without an intervening REWRITE, DELETE 

 

    or UNLOCK command.

 

    This is an incorrect use of file control requests.

 

 

System Action:  The task that would have entered deadlock is abended with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Examine the previous requests made by this transaction against this file to identify the cause of the deadlock, then correct the error. In 

some cases (particularly when the file is being accessed in RLS mode or is using a coupling facility data table) this abend may indicate a programming error 

in the program that issued the file control requests.

 

Modules: DFHEIFC, DFHDMPCA

 

 

 

 

AFCH

 

Explanation:  The transaction has issued a request for a remote shared data table for which it has an active browse, but in the meantime the table has been

System Action:  The requesting transaction abends with a transaction dump.

 

CICS continues normally.

 

User Response:  In the application owning region, take whatever action normally follows the issue of a FORCE request in, or the failure of, the file owning 

CICS system.

Explanation:  DFHFCU issued a call to DFHFCFS to open a file. A purged error was returned from DFHFCFS because the task has been waiting for a 

resource longer than the DTIMEOUT interval specified for the CSFU transaction.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. CICS processing continues.

 

User Response:  Examine the dump to determine the cause of the error. A system dump can be produced by adding the appropriate dump table entry using 

the CEMT SET TRDUMPCODE command.

AFCK

 

Explanation:  The transaction issued a file update request (READ UPDATE, WRITE or DELETE) against an RLS mode data set for which a DFSMSdss 

non-BWO backup was in progress.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. CICS processing continues.

 

User Response:  All new file update requests are prohibited when a non-BWO backup is in progress for an RLS mode data set. This restriction is 

automatically lifted when the backup completes. (A non-BWO backup is any type of backup operation other than a Backup While Open backup.) When the 

backup has completed, retry the transaction.

AFCM

 

Explanation:  During the loading of a data table by the CFTL transaction, an abend was detected, or a domain call returned a response (such as 

DISASTER) after which normal processing could not continue.

 

System Action:  A message is issued (one of DFHFC0945, DFHFC0946, or DFHFC0947). Loading of the data table is terminated and CFTL abends.

 

User Response:  If this abend is produced as a result of an abend during loading, message DFHFC0945 is issued. If it is a result of a domain call failure, 

depending on which domain the failure was returned by, one of the messages DFHFC0946 or DFHFC0947 is issued. Refer to the description of the message 

for further information and guidance.

 

Module:  DFHDTLX

 

 

 

 

AFCN

 

Explanation:  The transaction issued a file request that caused file control to attempt to create a journal record but the record was too large for the journal 

buffer to accommodate. This indicates that a journal referenced in the file definition is using an MVS logstream, which in turn, is using a coupling facility 

structure which has been defined with a MAXBUFSIZE parameter less than the recommended 64000.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Redefine the coupling facility structure that the logstream is using with a MAXBUFSIZE parameter of 64000. The journal in error can be the 

forward recovery log or the journal used for auto-archiving. If the module that detected the error is DFHDMPCA, the error is associated with a journal 

referenced in the definition of the CSD (DFHCSD).

DFHDTLX is for use by CICS system transaction CFTL. This loads a Shared Data Table.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated. CICS processing continues.

 

User Response:  Establish why an attempt was made to attach CFTL illegally, or why a transaction definition specified DFHDTLX as the program to be given 

control.

 

Module:  DFHDTLX

 

 

 

 

AFCR

 

Explanation:  The program issued a file control request against a file opened in RLS mode.  While executing this request, CICS detected that the 

SMSVSAM server address space had failed.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

CICS disables all further RLS accesses and initiates error recovery.

 

User Response:  Retry the transaction when the server is available again

 

If the SMSVSAM server fails, it should normally automatically restart itself as quickly as possible. If this does not happen, consult the VSAM documentation 

which provides further guidance on debugging problems in the SMSVSAM server.

 

Modules: DFHEIFC, DFHDMPCA

 

AFCS

 

Explanation:  The program issued a file control request against a file opened in RLS mode.  VSAM was unable to perform this request because the 

SMSVSAM server address space was inactive.

 

However, if an offsite restart is being performed (that is, OFFSITE=YES was specified as a system initialization override), this transaction abend is also 

issued even if the SMSVSAM server address space is active. This is because RLS access is not allowed during an offsite restart for any RLS file control 

requests other than those issued by transactions which have been attached by CICS to perform RLS recovery work.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Retry the transaction when the server is available again.

 

If the SMSVSAM server fails, it should normally automatically restart itself as quickly as possible. If this does not happen, consult the VSAM documentation 

which provides further guidance on debugging problems in the SMSVSAM server.

 

If an offsite restart is being performed, retry the transaction after RLS recovery has been completed when RLS access by user transactions is allowed again.

 

Modules: DFHEIFC, DFHDMPCA

 

AFCT

 

Explanation:  The program has made a file control request against a file opened in RLS mode.  The SMSVSAM server has been recycled since an earlier 

RLS request from the same unit of work. The same unit of work cannot issue requests against two different instances of the SMSVSAM server. Note that this 

abend will occur even if the earlier request was not successful.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Resubmit the transaction.

 

Modules: DFHEIFC, DFHDMPCA

 

AFCU

 

Explanation:  A program made a file control request against a file that is being accessed in VSAM RLS mode. The underlying data set is in lost locks state. 

File control requests are not allowed against a data set that is in lost locks state.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Recovery from lost locks is normally automatic. See the CICS Recovery and Restart Guide for a full explanation of lost locks recovery. You 

will not be able to issue any file control requests against this data set until all systems that owned locks at the time of the lock structure failure have 

completed their lost locks recovery.

 

See the CICS Recovery and Restart Guide for guidance on how to determine which CICS systems still have lost locks recovery pending, for information on 

commands that allow you to find the work that these systems have outstanding, and on commands that allow you to force a system to immediately complete 

lost locks recovery. The commands that force immediate completion of lost locks recovery should only be used as a last resort as they may cause loss of 

data integrity. It is better to allow the automatic recovery procedures to complete normally.

 

Modules: DFHEIFC, DFHDMPCA

 

AFCV

 

Explanation:  A request made against a file opened in RLS mode was unable to acquire a record lock. It waited for the lock, but the wait time exceeded the 

maximum wait time applicable to that request.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

CICS prints message DFHFC0164 and message DFHFC0165 which identify the transaction or transactions that were immediately in front of this transaction 

in the queue for the lock. Normally this transaction or these transactions are the owners of the lock, although this is not the case if a chain of requests for the 

record has built up.

 

User Response:  Retry the transaction.

 

If the problem recurs, see messages DFHFC0164 and DFHFC0165 to determine the transaction that is holding the lock. In most cases the problem lies with 

the lock owner rather than the transaction that has failed.

 

Examples of causes of timeouts are as follows:

 


   The transaction that holds the lock has a design error. For example:

 

 

    -   A conversational transaction updates a recoverable record and then issues a terminal control read. It does not issue syncpoint (and therefore does not 

        release the lock) until the end user has responded to the terminal control read. It may therefore hold the lock for a considerable period.

    -   A transaction updates very many records in recoverable files before issuing syncpoint. You are recommended to keep the number of updates made 

        within a unit of work small and to issue frequent syncpoints to ensure that locks are released regularly.

 


   The system in which the lock holder is running is experiencing severe performance degradation. Investigate the reason for the performance degradation.

 

 


   There is a deadlock between RLS and another resource manager. For example one transaction may be holding an RLS lock and waiting for a lock on a 

 

    transient data queue. The transaction that times out may hold the lock on the transient data queue and be waiting for the RLS lock. RLS can detect 

    deadlocks only when all the locks involved in the deadlock are RLS locks. A deadlock such as this can appear to RLS to be a long wait for a lock and is 

    reported as a time out. Examine the design of the transactions to determine whether resource manager deadlocks can occur.

 


   It may be possible for RLS deadlocks to be reported as RLS timeouts if VSAM does not perform deadlock detection until after the time out value for the 

 

    request occurred. For example, assume that DEADLOCK_TIMEOUT in specified as (15,4) in SYS1.PARMLIB. This means that VSAM does not attempt 

    to detect cross-MVS deadlocks until 4 periods of 15 (that is, 60) seconds have elapsed.  If DTIMOUT was not active for the transaction and the SIT 

    specified FTIMEOUT=30, the RLS request times out after 30 seconds, before VSAM has attempted to detect cross-MVS deadlocks. Adjust FTIMEOUT, 

    DTIMOUT, and DEADLOCK_DETECTION to avoid such effects.

 

 

Modules: DFHEIFC, DFHDMPCA

 

AFCW

 

Explanation:  The program issued a file control request against a file opened in RLS mode.  VSAM RLS detected that this request would cause a deadlock. 

This transaction is abended in order to break the deadlock chain.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

CICS prints message DFHFC0166 and message DFHFC0167 which identify the other transactions in the deadlock chain.

 

User Response:  Retry the transaction.

 

Examine the logic of all the programs involved in the deadlock chain to determine whether they could be improved to avoid possible sources of deadlock. See 

the CICS Application Programming Guide for guidance on how to write programs that avoid deadlocks.

 

Modules: DFHEIFC, DFHDMPCA

 

AFCY

 

Explanation:  The transaction issued a file request resulting in a call to the main file control program (DFHFCFR). During the processing of the request the 

transaction was purged (that is, was the subject of an explicit PURGE or FORCEPURGE request, was timed out, or was selected by CICS for termination in 

an attempt to alleviate an SOS condition). A "purged" response was returned from DFHFCFR to its caller.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

Exception trace entries are made between the point at which the purge is detected and the issuing of the abend.

 

User Response:  In some instances, for example if the transaction was explicitly purged, no further action is necessary.

 

Otherwise examine the exception trace and the transaction dump to identify the point at which the purge occurred.

 

Modules: DFHDMPCA, DFHEIFC

 

AFCZ

 

Explanation:  The transaction issued a file request resulting in a call to the main file control program (DFHFCFR). A "disastrous error" response was 

returned from DFHFCFR to its caller.

 

System Action:  At the time the error is detected, CICS writes a message to the console, records an exception trace entry, and takes a system dump. The 

trace and dump identify the point of error.

 

Subsequently, the task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  The system programmer should use the trace and dumps to determine what the error is, and why it has occurred.

 

Modules: DFHDMPCA, DFHEIFC

Explanation:  The CICS definition file (CSD) manager (DFHDMPCA) issued a request to DFHFCFS to enable, open or close the DFHCSD file. A "disastrous 

error" response was returned from DFHFCFS to DFHDMPCA.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

At the time the disastrous error is detected, CICS writes a message to the console, records an exception trace entry and takes a system dump.

 

CICS processing continues.

 

User Response:  The system programmer should examine the trace, the system dump and any related CICS messages to identify the cause of the error.

Explanation:  An attempt was made to attach a transaction specifying DFHFCQT as the program to be given control, but the transaction was not internally 

attached by CICS.

 

DFHFCQT is for use by CICS system transactions CFQS and CFQR. These provide support for VSAM RLS data set quiesce and unquiesce operations, 

DFSMSdss BWO and non-BWO backups, and certain other data set related operations.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated. CICS processing continues.

 

User Response:  Establish why an attempt was made to illegally attach CFQS or CFQR, or why a transaction definition specified DFHFCQT as the program 

to be given control.

 

Module:  DFHFCQT

 

AFDB

 

Explanation:  An attempt was made by CICS to internally attach a transaction specifying DFHFCQT as the program to be given control, and the transaction 

id was other than CFQS or CFQR.

 

DFHFCQT is for use by CICS system transactions CFQS and CFQR. These provide support for VSAM RLS data set quiesce and unquiesce operations, 

DFSMSdss BWO and non-BWO backups, and certain other data set related operations.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. CICS processing continues but it is probable that VSAM RLS data 

set quiesce support has been lost.

 

User Response:  Restart CICS. If the problem reoccurs, a more severe error is indicated. In this case, you will need assistance from IBM. You need further 

assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to proceed.

This abend indicates that this CICS system has completed its RLS offsite recovery, but an error occurred either in attempting to issue message 

DFHFC0575D which reports this fact, or in attempting to process the reply to message DFHFC0575D.

 

System Action:  CFOR is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. CICS processing continues.

 

User Response:  If you are using an automated procedure to check for and reply to message DFHFC0575D, then you should shut this CICS down and 

restart it specifying OFFSITE=YES again. If you are using manual procedures to check for completion of all RLS offsite recovery and to reply to message 

DFHFC0575D then you can "tick" this CICS off the list of systems which have completed their recovery, but you must ensure that it is not restarted with 

OFFSITE=NO until all other CICS systems have completed their RLS offsite recovery. Also note that until the system is restarted, RLS access will not be 

allowed by this system.

User Response:  Notify your system programmer to determine why the task has been purged.

 

Module:  DFHICP

 

 

 

 

AICH

 

Explanation:  The task was purged before a request to the storage manager (SM) domain was able to complete successfully. The domain that first detected 

the purged condition will have provided an exception trace.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Investigate why the task was purged. This is either as a result of a purge from the master terminal operator via the CEMT transaction, or by 

the task being timed out after waiting for longer than the DTIMOUT (deadlock timeout) value specified for the transaction.

 

If the master terminal operator purged the task, this may have been in an attempt to clear the system which appeared to be deadlocked for some reason.

 

If the task was timed out automatically as a result of the DTIMOUT value being exceeded, this may be due to insufficient main storage being available for the 

number of tasks in the system. If the amount of main storage cannot be increased, reduce the number of tasks in the system to avoid short-on-storage 

situations. Another possibility is to increase the value of the DTIMOUT option for the transaction.

AISV

 

Explanation:  A PURGED condition has occurred on a call to the storage manager domain (SM) to FREEMAIN a FCENT control block.

 

The domain that detected the original error provides an exception trace, a console message and, possibly, a system dump.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Investigate why the task was purged. This is either as a result of a purge from the master terminal operator via the CEMT transaction, or by 

the task being timed out after waiting for longer than the DTIMOUT (deadlock timeout) value specified for the transaction.

 

If the master terminal operator purged the task, this may have been in an attempt to clear the system which appeared to be deadlocked for some reason.

 

If the task was timed out automatically as a result of the DTIMOUT value being exceeded, this may be due to insufficient main storage being available for the 

number of tasks in the system. If the amount of main storage cannot be increased, reduce the number of tasks in the system to avoid short-on-storage 

situations. Another possibility is to increase the value of the DTIMOUT option for the transaction.

AIS9

 

Explanation:  The mirror program has detected that a DPL server program has returned in an invalid state following the completion of the LINK command. 

The server program or a program it linked to has initiated a synclevel 2 conversation with another program which in turn has issued a syncpoint. The server 

program has not responded to the syncpoint request which is still outstanding when control returns to the mirror program.

 

The mirror program only issues this abend code if the LINK request did not specify SYNCONRETURN.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Correct the design of the DTP application or applications initiated by the server program. If the SYNCONRETURN option is not specified on 

the LINK request, only the client program should initiate the syncpoint. If it is necessary to issue syncpoint requests from the DTP applications, consider 

using the SYNCONRETURN option on the LINK request. See the CICS Intercommunication Guide for further details of the LINK command and its options.

first detected the purged condition provides an exception trace.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Investigate why the task was purged. It was purged either as a result of a purge from the master terminal operator via the CEMT 

transaction, or by the task being timed out after waiting for longer than the DTIMOUT (deadlock timeout) value specified for the transaction.

 

If the master terminal operator purged the task, this may have been in an attempt to clear the system which appeared to be deadlocked for some reason.

 

If the task was timed out automatically as a result of the DTIMOUT value being exceeded, this may be due to insufficient main storage being available for the 

number of tasks in the system. If the amount of main storage cannot be increased, reduce the number of tasks in the system to avoid short-on-storage

AJMB

 

Explanation:  The CICS-JVM interface has rejected an attempt to invoke a Java program to run under control of a JVM because a previous JVM for the same 

CICS task terminated abnormally. The CICS-JVM interface is unable to create a JVM to run the Java program.

 

This error occurs when the previous JVM was terminated because of a Java program invoking the Java system.exit method and because errors occurred 

during the subsequent JVM termination. A system.exit invocation causes a forced termination of the JVM and the LE/370 runtime environment.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Examine why the previous JVM termination failed. Wherever possible avoid the use of system.exit to return from Java programs.

Module:  DFJCICS

 

AKCB

 

Explanation:  The CICS transaction manager restart task could not complete because a necessary step failed. The task has done some essential recovery 

operations and abnormally terminated itself with code AKCB.

 

System Action:  CICS writes a transaction dump for the transaction manager restart task.

 

CICS sends three messages to the console, one to identify the error detected by the transaction manager restart task, one to say that the task has failed, 

and one that gives you the option of cancelling CICS or letting it continue. Depending on the nature of the original error, you may see messages from some 

other system component (for example, an access method).

 

User Response:  Use the messages and dumps to find out the cause of the failure.

 

Module:  DFHKCRP

 

 

 

 

AKCC

 

Explanation:  The CICS transaction manager has abended the transaction because the purge threshold of its TRANCLASS has been reached. This is 

specified by the PURGETHRESH parameter on CEDA DEFINE TRANCLASS. See the CICS Resource Definition Guide manual for more details of this 

parameter.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abended and messages DFHAC2004 and DFHAC2236 are issued.  The transaction dump is suppressed for this abend 

code.

 

User Response:  Resubmit the transaction. The cause of the abend may be a temporary stress condition in the system.

 

If the problem persists, determine why the TRANCLASS purge threshold has been reached. Ensure that PURGETHRESH has been specified correctly. Also, 

ensure that the MAXACTIVE value of the TRANCLASS has not been set too low. Transactions attached after the MAXACTIVE limit has been reached are 

immediately queued subject to the PURGETHRESH limit.

 

If PURGETHRESH and MAXACTIVE are set correctly, look for a more general problem which has caused a decrease in the capacity of the system to 

execute transactions in the TRANCLASS. The decrease might, for example, be caused by a connected CICS region which processes requests for 

transactions in the TRANCLASS, if this connected region has slowed down.

 

Examine all resources (files, links, storage, and so on) used by the transactions in the TRANCLASS which is reaching the purge threshold and determine 

why the capacity of the system is reduced.

 

Modules: DFHXMAT, DFHXMCL

 

 

 

 

AKCE

 

Explanation:  While CICS transaction manager was recording changes to a transaction or profile definition, a write to the system log failed.

 

System Action:  CICS terminates the transaction with a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Use the dumps to find out why the write to the log failed.

 

Module:  DFHKCQ

 

AKCF

 

Explanation:  While CICS transaction manager was recording changes to a profile definition, a write to the catalog failed.

 

System Action:  CICS terminates the transaction with a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Use the dumps to find out why the write to the catalog failed.

 

Module:  DFHKCQ

 

AKCR

 

Explanation:  Transaction manager has received an invalid request code. The last AP F000 trace entry before the program control program (PCP) ABEND 

TRACE entry (TRACE ID 'F2', request code X'6000') will contain the invalid transaction manager request code in the fifth byte of the first section of the trace.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Determine the cause of the invalid request code and correct the problem.

 

Module:  DFHXCP

 

AKCS

 

Explanation:  A deadlock timeout condition has been detected. This condition may occur within a transaction that specifies DTIMOUT to be nonzero on its 

installed transaction definition. Deadlock timeout occurs when a transaction has been waiting or has been suspended for longer than the time specified in 

DTIMOUT.

 

The abend may be driven by a variety of internal CICS events, for example:

 


   A short on storage condition

 


   A temporary storage shortage

 


   ENQUEUE

 


   An ALLOCATE request

 


   A RETRIEVE WAIT request.

 

 

The abend can also occur if CICS stops running for a time, for example while an sdump is taken. This is because deadlock timeout is based on total elapsed 

time, and not just the time CICS is executing.

 

Analysis: The transaction receiving the AKCS abend must have been suspended or must be waiting for a reason such as a short on storage, enqueued on a 

lock, a short on temporary storage, a suspend after RETRIEVE WAIT, a suspend after ALLOCATE, or an implicit ALLOCATE within function shipping or 

terminal sharing support. If none of these apply, the trace might reveal some event that has caused CICS to stop running for a time.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated. A dump is not provided (even if a dump table entry has been set up) unless install/delete 

processing causes this abend, in which case a transaction dump is taken.

 

User Response:  The transaction should be reexecuted, and the situation causing the SUSPEND to occur may clear itself.

 

The AKCS abend is to be expected occasionally, unless DTIMOUT is set to zero. No special action is necessary.

 

Module:  DFHXCP

 

AKCT

 

Explanation:  A terminal read-time-out condition has been detected. The transaction has been waiting for a terminal input message for an interval longer 

than specified in the RTIMOUT value for that transaction.

 

If an EXEC CICS HANDLE ABEND has been issued for this task, the read that was timed-out is still outstanding. To cancel this read you should issue an 

EXEC CICS ABEND at the end of the user exit routine so that CICS can clean up the terminal's TCTTE.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated. A transaction dump is not provided.

 

User Response:  This abend is a normal one. Coding RTIMOUT in the PROFILE entry asks for the task to be abnormally terminated if the terminal does not 

send input within the specified time.

 

Module:  DFHXCP

 

AKCV

 

Explanation:  A bad return code was passed as a result of the resume of a task suspended by ICP.

 

System Action:  The transaction is terminated with a dump.

AKC2

 

Explanation:  A bad response has been received from a dispatcher (DS) domain call.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a transaction dump and a trace entry.

 

User Response:  Examine the trace entry for further information.

 

Module:  DFHXCP

 

 

 

 

AKC3

 

Explanation:  The task has been purged, probably due to operator action such as a CEMT TASK PURGE command. The task might also have been purged 

as a result of CICS issuing a purge request.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Use the transaction dump to determine why the task was purged. In particular, if the purge was operator initiated, the dump should be 

useful in determining why this task needed to be explicitly purged.

 

Modules: DFHXCP, DFHXMAT, DFHXMCL, DFHXMIQ, DFHXMTA

 

 

 

 

AKC6

 

Explanation:  DFHKC RESUME should always be preceded by DFHKC SUSPEND. If this protocol is violated then the transaction is abnormally terminated 

with abend code AKC6.

User Response:  Examine the trace entry for further information.

 

Module:  DFHXCP

 

AKC8

 

Explanation:  A bad response has been received from a call to the kernel (KE) domain during the processing of a task purge request.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abended with a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Examine the dump and any exception trace entries for further information.

 

Module:  DFHXCP

 

AKC9

 

Explanation:  An incorrect response has been received from a call to the enqueue (NQ) domain during the processing of a DFHKC TYPE=ENQ or a DFHKC 

TYPE=DEQ request.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Examine the dump and any exception trace entries for further information.  Since the DFHKC service is only used for internal enqueues, 

this abend indicates an error in CICS. You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for 

guidance on how to proceed.

request.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  This indicates a possible error in CICS code. An earlier CICS message is issued from the monitoring domain. Follow the user response for 

that message.

 

Module:  DFHCMP

 

AMSA

 

Explanation:  An input data stream received from a 3270 begins with a set buffer address (SBA) order but is not followed by two 1-byte address fields. This 

is probably due to a hardware error.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  It may be possible to bypass the problem by entering two spaces before the data to be entered.

 

If the problem persists, you need further assistance. You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem 

Determination Guide for guidance on how to proceed.

 

Module:  DFHMSP

 

AMSB

 

Explanation:  An internal logic error has been detected in module DFHMSP.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Retry the CMSG transaction, specifying operands in a different order. If this fails, keep the dump and contact your IBM Support Center.

 

Module:  DFHMSP

 

AMSC

 

Explanation:  The task was purged before a GETMAIN request to the storage manager (SM) domain was able to complete successfully. The task that first 

detected the purged condition will have provided an exception trace.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Investigate why the task was purged. This is either as a result of a purge from the master terminal operator via the CEMT transaction, or by 

the task being timed out after waiting for longer than the DTIMOUT (deadlock timeout) value specified for the transaction.

 

If the master terminal operator purged the task, this may have been in an attempt to clear the system which appeared to be deadlocked for some reason.

 

If the task was timed out automatically as a result of the DTIMOUT value being exceeded, this may be due to insufficient main storage being available for the 

number of tasks in the system. If the amount of main storage cannot be increased, reduce the number of tasks in the system to avoid short-on-storage 

situations. Another possibility is to increase the value of the DTIMOUT option for the transaction.

 

Module:  DFHMSP

 

AMSD

 

Explanation:  An error (INVALID, DISASTER, or unexpected EXCEPTION response) has occurred on a call to the storage manager (SM) domain. The 

domain that detected the original error provides an exception trace, a console message and, possibly, a system dump (depending on the options specified in 

the dump table).

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  See the related error message produced by the domain that detected the original error.

User Response:  See the related message produced by the domain that detected the original error.

 

Module:  DFHOTR

 

APCF

 

Explanation:  A CICS task has invoked a program which was defined as PL/I, but the program was not compiled with a supported PL/I compiler.

 

System Action:  CICS terminates the task, and disables the program.

 

User Response:  Check that the program is PL/I. If the program is PL/I, recompile it with the PL/I optimizing compiler; you may need to change the source 

program. If the program is not PL/I, redefine it correctly.

 

Module:  DFHAPLI

 

 

 

 

APCG

 

Explanation:  The transaction was purged either by master terminal actions or due to deadlock timeout actions as part of a request to the loader for a 

usable program copy. Deadlock timeout could be caused by a program whose size exceeds the available space in the DSAs or EDSAs.

 

System Action:  CICS terminates the task with a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Use the dump to investigate why the transaction was purged. This may be due to waiting for loader resources or for program storage. 

Check the program size.  It may be necessary to increase the overall size limits of the DSAs or EDSAs.

User Response:  Ensure that the program is correctly defined to CICS.

 

Module:  DFHAPLI

 

 

 

 

APCN

 

Explanation:  An attempt to release an internal CICS program, a mapset, or a partitionset because the program, mapset or partitionset has not been loaded 

or has already been deleted. This is probably an internal CICS error.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. The name of the program for which the RELEASE was attempted 

can be found in the abend dump at TCAPCPI.

 

User Response:  This is either an internal CICS error or is due to the overwriting of CICS internal control blocks. You need further assistance from IBM to 

resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to proceed.

 

Modules: DFHAMPEN, DFHFEP, DFHMCP, DFHMCPE, DFHMCY, DFHPHP, DFHTBSSP, DFHZCPLN

User Response:  See the related message from the domain that detected the original error.

 

Module:  DFHAPXM

 

APCS

 

Explanation:  An attempt to run the program failed because CICS was unable to make a successful connection with Language Environment to determine the 

run-time characteristics of the program. This abend is accompanied by message DFHAP1200 which gives the reason code set by Language Environment 

indicating the nature of the error.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated and the program is disabled.

 

User Response:  Refer to the Language Environment Debugging Guide and Runtime Messages manual for the meaning of the reason code, and take 

whatever action is necessary to correct the error.

 

Module:  DFHAPLI


APCT

 
Explanation:  One of the following has occurred:

1.  The program name in the EXEC CICS HANDLE ABEND program is not usable at the time an abend occurs because:

     The program is not on the relocatable program library (RPL).
     The program is disabled.
     The program cannot be loaded.

2.  An attempt to load a mapset or partitionset failed because although the program is defined to CICS

    It is not available on the RPL, or
    It is disabled, or
    It cannot be autoinstalled.

3.  An attempt to link to, load, or release an internal CICS program failed because:
 
    The program is not on the RPL.
    The program is disabled.
    The program cannot be loaded.

Problem Determination:  The trace preceding the abend indicates the program, mapset, or partitionset that could not be loaded, linked to, or released. The 

name is also in TCAPCEPI.

System Action:  The transaction requiring the program is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

User Response:  In cases 1 and 2, define the program, mapset partitionset to CICS using CEDA and ensure it is enabled.

In case 3, the definition of a CICS-provided module is incorrect. Check for associated messages issued during CICS start up.

DFHZCPLN, DFHZQ00, DFHZXCU

 

 

 

 

APCW

 

Explanation:  The program language is defined as COBOL but the level of the compiler under which it was originally compiled cannot be determined. Most 

probably, the program was compiled under an OS/VS COBOL II compiler but the required level of support for that compiler is not present in the system.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated and the program is disabled.

 

User Response:  Check that OS/VS, COBOL II or Language Environment support is present in the system and that the required interface modules (IGZECIC 

or CEECCICS) have been correctly loaded during system startup.

 

Module:  DFHAPLI

 

APCY

 

Explanation:  In an MVS/ESA environment, a CICS macro request has been issued from a PL/I or COBOL application. Alternatively, it is possible that the 

application program has been link edited without the EXEC interface module (for example, DFHECI or DFHELII) which is used by the CICS high-level 

language programming interface.  See the CICS System Definition Guide for details of what has to be done to include this module.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated and the program is disabled.

 

User Response:  Remove the macro request from the application program.

 

Module:  DFHAPLI

 

APCZ

 

Explanation:  An attempt has been made to run either an 'old-style' application program (that is, a program with a pre-release 1.6 or a DFHE program stub) 

or an OS/VS COBOL program, either having been link-edited with the RENT or REFR attributes. These types of programs are not reentrant and therefore 

cannot be loaded into read-only storage.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated.

 

User Response:  Relink the program without the RENT and REFR attributes.

 

Module:  DFHAPLI

 

 

 

 

APC0

 

Explanation:  A serious error occurred in a call to the program manager domain when trying to link a system program.

 

System Action:  CICS terminates the task with a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Use the dump to investigate why the error occurred. Look at the trace records prior to the error for abnormal conditions in processing the 

PGLK domain call.  This may be due to a problem with directory manager, loader, or storage manager. Check the program size. It may be necessary to 

increase the overall size limits of the DSAs or EDSAs.

 

Modules: DFHEICRE, DFHEIDEF, DFHEIDEL, DFHEIINS, DFHPCP, DFHMCY

 

 

 

 

APC1

 

Explanation:  A request for a TGT exceeding 64KB has been detected.

 

System Action:  CICS abnormally terminates the transaction and disables the installed program definition.

 

User Response:  Change the application program to reduce the working storage requirement.  Perform CEMT NEWCOPY and ENABLE for the program when 

it has been corrected.

 

Module:  DFHAPLI

 

APC2

 

Explanation:  An illegal branch has been attempted by a Language Environment user program following an abend condition with an active handle label 

abend. Usually an Out-Of-Block GOTO will have resulted, implying that the program tried to branch to, for example, an inactive block.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated and the program is disabled.

 

User Response:  Use the dump and trace to determine the cause of the error and amend the GOTO in error.

 

Module:  DFHAPLI

 

APC3

 

Explanation:  An attempt to run the program failed because the program appeared to be defined to CICS as Language Environment but no Language 

Environment support was present in the system and no other language environment was able to run the program.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated and the program is disabled.

 

User Response:  Redefine the program to CICS in a language other than Language Environment.

 

Module:  DFHAPLI

 

APC4

 

Explanation:  A call to the loader domain to define program ILBOCOM failed.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated.

 

User Response:  Check that the library containing the OS/VS COBOL runtime library modules is named in the DFHRPL DD concatenation.

 

Module:  DFHPCPC2

 

APC5

 

Explanation:  A call to the loader domain to load program ILBOCOM failed.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated.

 

User Response:  Check that the library containing the OS/VS COBOL runtime library modules is included in the DFHRPL concatenation. If it is, obtain and 

check a trace of the failure. If no reasonable explanation is found (such as lack of storage), you will need further assistance from IBM. You need further 

assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to proceed.

 

Module:  DFHPCPC2

 

APC6

 

Explanation:  An internal error has occurred.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated.

 

User Response:  See the associated X'F230' Exception trace entry for further diagnostic information. For an ACQUIRE error ensure the associated module is 

in a library in the CICS DFHRPL concatenation. For an IDENTIFY error make sure that the associated module has not been MVS LOADed for example by 

the inadvertent link-editing of a VS COBOL II program with a COBOL subprogram.

 

Module:  DFHPCPC2

 

APC7

 

Explanation:  An MVS IDENTIFY call has given a non zero return code. The IDENTIFY call was being used to make the entry point ILBOCOM0 known to

APP1

 

Explanation:  The DFHIC TYPE=GET response code was not a normal response.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Analyze the dump. The response code is in the low-order byte of register 0.

 

Module:  DFHP3270

 

APP2

 

Explanation:  The length of data that has been passed to DFHP3270 via temporary storage is less than or equal to 5.

 

Problem Determination:  Register 6 points to the data retrieved from temporary storage via a DFHIC TYPE=GET macro invocation. The layout of this data 

is:

 


   Terminal data area length (2 bytes)

 


   Write control indicator (1 byte)

 


   Write control or carriage control character (1 byte)

 


   Data (variable length)

 

 

Analysis: DFHP3270 has been called to handle a print request from a 3270 Information Display System terminal. It obtains from temporary storage the data 

to be printed, via a DFHIC TYPE=GET invocation. It ensures that some data to be printed is present. The area returned from temporary storage contains the 

data to be printed preceded by 4 bytes as described above. DFHP3270 has found that, because the length of data passed to it is less than or equal to 5, 

there is no data to be printed.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Check the user DFHTEP. If it is not at fault, submit an APAR.

 

If this abend has occurred, the data that DFHP3270 obtained from temporary storage was probably put there with an incorrect length. The user may have 

requested indirectly that this data be placed in temporary storage either by an application request for printing (for example ISSUE PRINT) or by pressing the 

Print Request key. However, CICS should control the data length for this request. Under normal circumstances, the only way the user could have requested 

directly that data is to be placed in temporary storage is in the user's TEP. The user should check any invocations of DFHIC TYPE=PUT in handling print 

requests, particularly when dealing with the "printer unavailable or busy" condition, and ensure that the length field is set correctly.

 

Module:  DFHP3270

 

APP3

 

Explanation:  An attempt to request data has been sent to a nonprinter or unsupported device type by either:

 


   A terminal operator entering CSPP as a transaction code, or

 


   A transaction issuing a DFHTEP request.

 

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated. A CICS transaction dump is not provided.

 

User Response:

 

1.  Ensure that the terminal operator ceases to use CSPP as a transaction code, or

2.  Correct the user DFHTEP program.

 

Module:  DFHP3270

 

APR1

 

Explanation:  An abnormal DFHIC TYPE=PUT response code was received during print key processing.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. The keyboard of the terminal on which the print key was depressed 

remains locked to indicate the failure of the operation.

 

User Response:  Analyze the dump. The response code is in low-order byte of register 0.

 

Module:  DFHPRK

 

APSJ

 

Explanation:  The abending transaction invoked the system spooler initialization program (DFHPSIP) illegally, that is from a program other than the CICS 

module, DFHSIJ1.

 

System Action:  CICS terminates the transaction abnormally. The EXEC CICS HANDLE ABEND command can not handle this abend.

 

User Response:  Remove any calls or links to DFHPSIP from your application programs. If you can find no invocation of DFHPSIP in your application, you 

need further assistance to resolve this problem. You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination 

Guide for guidance on how to proceed.

 

Module:  DFHPSIP

 

APST

 

Explanation:  A task issued a SPOOL command without the mandatory NOHANDLE operand.

 

System Action:  CICS terminates the task abnormally with a dump.

 

User Response:  Correct the syntax of the command, specifying NOHANDLE.

 

Module:  DFHEPS

 

APSU

 

Explanation:  The CICS SVC passed an invalid JES interface return code to the CICS system spooler (an MVS subtask).

 

System Action:  CICS terminates the task abnormally.

 

User Response:  This is an internal error - check any JES failures that occurred at the same time.

 

You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to proceed.

Explanation:  A CICS area, used to store a JES interface return code, contained an invalid value.

 

System Action:  CICS terminates the task abnormally with a dump.

 

User Response:  Check the syntax and input data of the spool commands issued by the failing transaction. Check any JES failures that occurred at the 

same time.

 

This is an internal CICS error. You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for 

guidance on how to proceed.

 

Module:  DFHPSPST

 

APTI

 

Explanation:  The task was purged before a GETMAIN request to the storage manager (SM) domain was able to complete successfully. The domain that 

first detected the purged condition will have provided an exception trace.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Investigate why the task was purged. It was purged either as a result of a purge from the master terminal operator via the CEMT 

transaction, or by the task being timed out after waiting for longer than the DTIMOUT (deadlock timeout) value specified for the transaction.

 

If the master terminal operator purged the task, this may have been in an attempt to clear the system which appeared to be deadlocked for some reason.

 

If the task was timed out automatically as a result of the DTIMOUT value being exceeded, this may be due to insufficient main storage being available for the 

number of tasks in the system. If the amount of main storage cannot be increased, reduce the number of tasks in the system to avoid short-on-storage 

situations. Another possibility is to increase the value of the DTIMOUT option for the transaction.

 

Module:  DFHPSPST

 

APTJ

 

Explanation:  An error (INVALID, DISASTER, or unexpected EXCEPTION response) has occurred on a call to the storage manager (SM) domain. The 

domain that detected the original error will have provided an exception trace, a console message and, possibly, a system dump (depending on the options 

specified in the dump table).

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  See the related message from the domain that detected the original error.

APUL

 

Explanation:

 

Note:  The description of this abend also applies to APUM, APUN and APUO.

 

CICS cannot find a match for a function code in the language definition

table, because the parameterized resource definition contains an

unrecognized resource type code.

 

The abend code issued depends on the DFHPUP operation that was invoked before the error occurred:

 

Abend     DFHPUP operation

APUL      FLATTEN

APUM      TRANCASE

APUN      COMPARE

APUO      BACKTRANS

 

The cause of the abend is either:

 

1.  A language definition table (DFHEITSP or DFHEITCU) in the library is invalid for the CICS release you are running, or

2.  A CICS logic error has occurred.

 

System Action:

 


   In a CICS environment, the CEDA transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 


   In a batch environment, processing is abnormally terminated with an operating system dump.

 

 

User Response:  Your response depends on which of the two possible reasons apply:

 

1.  Ensure that the DFHEITSP and DFHEITCU modules in the library are valid for this release of CICS.

2.  You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to proceed.

Module:  DFHPUP  .*---------------------------------------------------------------

 

APUZ

 

Explanation:  CICS has found an unrecognized resource type code in a CSD record. The unrecognized code does not match any of the function codes in 

the language definition table. This abend can occur for one of the following reasons:

 

1.  You are using a CICS release that does not support a type of definition that was created on the CSD file by a later CICS release.

2.  The language definition table (DFHEITSP or DFHEITCU) is invalid for this CICS release.

3.  The CSD manager (DFHDMP) has passed an invalid CSD record buffer to DFHPUP. This is a CICS internal logic error.

 

System Action:

 

   In a CICS environment, the CEDA transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump

   In a batch environment, processing is abnormally terminated with an operating system dump.

 

 

User Response:  Determine which of the possible reasons caused the error. If you can eliminate reasons 1 and 2, you can assume that reason 3 applies.

 

Take action corresponding to the reason you have established as follows:

 

1.  Avoid operations on groups containing definition-types that are unsupported by the CICS release you are running.

2.  Ensure that the library contains versions of DFHEITSP and DFHEITCU that are valid for the CICS release you are running.

3.  You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to proceed.

 

Module:  DFHPUP

 

APXA

 

Explanation:  The user transaction's profile could not be found.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. The user transaction is not started.

 

User Response:  Check that the profile name in the user transaction definition is correct, and that this profile has been defined.

 

Module:  DFHAPXM

 

ARCB

 

Explanation:  CICS has attempted to enable a task-related user exit, or a global user exit during initialization, but failed because the exit program could not 

be found.

 

On all types of start, CICS attempts to enable DFHEDP, the EXEC DLI task-related user exit. On an emergency restart, CICS enables transaction backout 

exit programs as specified by the first two TBEXITS system initialization parameters.

 

On all types of start, CICS attempts to enable file control backout programs as specified by the third, fourth, fifth and sixth TBEXITS system initialization 

parameters.

 

System Action:  CICS issues a message to the console indicating which exit program is involved. CICS initialization then terminates abnormally with a 

system dump.

 

User Response:  If the associated message indicates that program DFHEDP could not be found, check that IBM-supplied group DFHEDP is included in the 

group list used at CICS cold or initial start time.

 

For transaction backout exit programs, including the file control backout programs, ensure the program has been defined and is in a library available to CICS.

 

If necessary, use the dump to find out why the exit program could not be enabled.

 

Module:  DFHRCEX

 

ARHA

 

Explanation:  The SAA resource recovery interface has been invoked with an invalid first parameter. The first parameter should be the code of the function to 

be performed. This is a CICS internal logic error.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  A level 2 trace for 'CP' of the transaction shows the course of events before this error occurred (such as the modules called and their 

parameters) plus details of the error itself. You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination 

Guide for guidance on how to proceed.

 

Module:  DFHCPIR

 

ARHB

 

Explanation:  The SAA resource recovery interface has been invoked with an invalid number of parameters for the call.

 

System Action:  the transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  The exception trace point produced with this abend contains the SAA resource recovery verb name that was issued incorrectly. Use this to 

determine where the application program was in error and amend application program accordingly. The SAA Resource Recovery Reference Manual, 

SC31-6821, provides a detailed description of the SAA resource recovery verbs and how they should be called.

 

Module:  DFHCPIR

 

ARHC

 

Explanation:  The SAA resource recovery interface has detected an unexpected return code from the syncpoint program. This is a CICS internal logic error.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

parameters) plus details of the error itself. You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination 

Guide for guidance on how to proceed.

 

Module:  DFHCPIR

 

ARM0

 

Explanation:  An attempt was made to attach a transaction specifying DFHRMXN3 as the program to be given control, but the transaction was not internally 

attached by CICS.

 

DFHRMXN3 is for use by CICS system transaction CSKP. This provides support for activity keypoints,

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated. CICS processing continues.

 

User Response:  Establish why an attempt was made to attach CSKP incorrectly, or why a transaction definition specified DFHRMXN3 as the program to be 

given control.

 

Module:  DFHRMXN3

 

ARPA

 

Explanation:  An unexpected response from DFHSUSN has occurred when trying to sign off a user of the CRTE transaction in the target system when 

processing a CANCEL request.

 

This abend can be caused by incorrect use of the VTAM VARY INACT command. Otherwise it indicates that there may be an error in CICS.

 

System Action:  The CSSF transaction (CRTE cancel processor transaction) is terminated with an ARPA abend.

 

User Response:  Ensure that the VTAM VARY inact command is used correctly. If this is not the cause of the abend, you need further assistance from IBM 

to correct this problem. You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on 

how to proceed.

ASCP

 

Explanation:  A task which has issued an unconditional DFHSC TYPE=GETMAIN request has been purged while waiting for sufficient contiguous main 

storage to become free.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Investigate why the task was purged. This will either have been as a result of a purge from the master terminal operator via the CEMT 

transaction, or by the task being timed out after waiting for longer than the DTIMOUT (deadlock timeout) value specified for the transaction.

 

If the task was purged by the master terminal operator then this may have been in an attempt to clear the system which appeared to be deadlocked for some 

reason.

 

If the task was timed out automatically as a result of the DTIMOUT value being exceeded then this may be due to insufficient main storage being available for 

the number of tasks in the system. If the amount of main storage cannot be increased then the number of tasks in the system should be reduced to avoid 

short-on-storage situations. Another possibility would be to increase the value of the DTIMOUT option for the transaction.

Explanation:  The TCP/IP listener task CSOL has abended.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Investigate why the transaction was abended. The exception trace prior to this abend gives more information as to why this abend was 

issued.

 

Module:  DFHSOL

 

ASPA

 

Explanation:  The task was purged before a request to recovery manager (RM) domain was able to complete successfully. The domain that first detected 

the purged condition provides an exception trace.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. If processing is at a point where data integrity might not be maintained, 

CICS is abnormally terminated.

 

User Response:  Investigate why the task was purged. This is either as a result of a purge from the master terminal operator via the CEMT transaction, or by 

the task being timed out after waiting for longer than the DTIMOUT (deadlock timeout) value specified for the transaction.

 

If the master terminal operator purged the task, this may have been in an attempt to clear the system which appeared to be deadlocked for some reason.

 

If the task was timed out automatically as a result of the DTIMOUT value being exceeded, this may be due to insufficient main storage being available for the 

number of tasks in the system. If the amount of main storage cannot be increased, reduce the number of tasks in the system to avoid short-on-storage 

situations. Another possibility is to increase the value of the DTIMOUT option for the transaction.

 

If CICS is abnormally terminated, it should be emergency restarted to ensure that data integrity is maintained.

 

Module:  DFHAPAC

 

ASPB

 

Explanation:  An error (INVALID, DISASTER or unexpected EXCEPTION response) has occurred on a call to the recovery manager (RM) domain. The 

domain that detected the original error will have provided an exception trace, a console message and, possibly, a system dump (depending on the options 

specified in the dump table).

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. If processing is at a point where data integrity might not be maintained, 

CICS is abnormally terminated.

 

User Response:  See the related message from the domain that detected the original error. If CICS was abnormally terminated, it should be emergency 

restarted to ensure that data integrity is maintained.

 

Module:  DFHAPAC

 

ASPC

 

Explanation:  An error (INVALID or DISASTER) has occurred on a call to the bridge syncpoint routine (DFHBRSP). The domain that detected the original 

error will have provided an exception trace, and, possibly, a system dump (depending on the options specified in the dump table).

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  See the related message from the domain that detected the original error.

 

Module:  DFHSPP

 

ASPD

 

Explanation:  The transaction requested syncpoint via EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT, or rollback via EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK, but this is not 

allowed in a transaction that is associated with an OTS transaction.

 

System Action:  CICS terminates the transaction abnormally. EXEC CICS HANDLE ABEND command cannot handle this abend.

 

User Response:  The error indicates an invalid attempt to syncpoint the transaction.

 

If DB2 is being accessed in the transaction, check that the DB2ENTRY or DB2CONN pool definition used by the transaction does not specify 

DROLLBACK(YES).

 

Module:  DFHEISP

 

ASPF

 

Explanation:  CICS issued an internal syncpoint request resulting in a syncpoint with an intersystem session which has returned ROLLEDBACK to recovery 

manager (RM) domain. As a result, the transaction is abnormally terminated because the unit of work which was being syncpointed has been backed out.

 

This could result from shutting down IRC or from the failure of a connected CICS region.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated. Recoverable resources updated by the unit of work are backed out and locks released. The EXEC 

CICS HANDLE ABEND command cannot handle this abend.

 

Message DFHAC2215 is sent to the terminal end user if possible, and message DFHAC2245 is sent to transient data destination CSMT.

 

User Response:  Determine why the remote intersystem session returned a ROLLEDBACK response to the syncpoint request. Once this has been corrected 

retry the transaction.

 

To avoid ASPF abends in future, ensure that no in-flight units of work exist before shutting down IRC.

 

Module:  DFHAPAC

 

ASPI

 

Explanation:  During CICS synchronization level 1 (synclevel 1) commit, an unexpected FMH or no data has been received from the partner system. Local 

resources and synclevel 2 partners have been committed, but synclevel 1 function-shipped resource updates may have been backed out.

 

System Action:  The transaction does not abend. CICS synclevel 1 commit processing continues, with the aim of committing as many synclevel 1 resources 

as possible.

 

User Response:  Examine the transaction dump to determine why the FMH was invalid or missing, It is likely that the error is in the remote system.

 

See the CICS Family: Communicating from CICS on System/390 for more information about syncpointing.

 

Module:  DFHCR2U

 

ASPJ

 

Explanation:  During CICS synchronization level 1 (synclevel 1) commit, unexpected syncpoint message data has been received from the partner system. 

Local resources and synclevel 2 partners have been committed, but synclevel 1 function-shipped resource updates may have been backed out.

 

System Action:  The transaction does not abend. CICS synclevel 1 commit processing continues, with the aim of committing as many synclevel 1 resources 

as possible.

 

User Response:  Examine the transaction dump to determine why the message data was invalid. It is likely that the error is in the remote system.

 

See the CICS Family: Communicating from CICS on System/390 for more information about syncpointing.

 

Module:  DFHCR2U

 

ASPN

 

Explanation:  A transaction has issued an EXEC CICS RETURN in backout required program state. The backout required program state is set when an 

application receives or issues an abend, or receives a backout request on a protected conversation.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated. Recoverable resources updated by the unit of work are backed out and locks released. The EXEC 

CICS HANDLE ABEND command cannot handle this abend.

 

Message DFHAC2216 is sent to the terminal end user if possible, and message DFHAC2246 is sent to transient data destination CSMT.

 

User Response:  To avoid the transaction abend, the application should code an EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT command before the EXEC CICS RETURN. A 

syncpoint issued in 'backout required' program state results in a backout being performed, and the ROLLEDBACK condition returned on the EXEC CICS 

SYNCPOINT command. If this condition is then handled, a subsequent EXEC CICS RETURN will complete successfully. For LU61 conversations the 

application should issue an EXEC CICS FREE followed by an EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK, in order to avoid a subsequent ASP8 abend.

 

Module:  DFHAPAC

 

ASPO

 

Explanation:  An intersystem session failed while a syncpoint was being taken. The intersystem session that failed was the link to the coordinator system. 

The failure occurred during the indoubt period of syncpoint processing. As a result this CICS system is in doubt as to the outcome of the unit of work for the 

transaction.

 

The unit of work is not shunted to await the return of the coordinator system, but is instead unilaterally committed. The unit of work is not shunted for one of 

the following reasons:

 

   The transaction definition specifies WAIT(NO).

   The unit of work includes an MRO session to a back-level CICS system which does not support the WAIT(YES) option, and the role of the session in the 

 

    unit of work is such that it cannot await the return of the coordinator system.

 

   The unit of work includes an LU6.1 session, and the role of the session in the unit of work is such that it cannot await the return of the coordinator system.

   The unit of work involves a task related user exit which is not enabled with the INDOUBTWAIT option.

   The unit of work has updated a recoverable transient data destination, which is defined with WAIT(NO).

   The unit of work involves the installation of CICS resource definitions from the CSD (CICS system definition) file.

The unit of work is committed, rather than backed out, because the transaction definition specifies ACTION(COMMIT).

 

The fact that the unit of work is committed is remembered by the recovery manager (RM) domain until the unit of work is resynchronized with the coordinator 

system. At this time, according to whether the coordinator system committed or backed out, the recovery manager domain issues resynchronization 

messages reporting whether or not the resolution of the unit of work in the subordinate system was consistent with the coordinator system.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated. Recoverable resources updated by the unit of work are committed and locks released. The EXEC 

CICS HANDLE ABEND command cannot handle this abend.

 

Message DFHAC2202 is sent to the terminal end user if possible, and message DFHAC2232 is sent to transient data destination CSMT.

 

User Response:  Any updates performed by the unit of work are committed. There is a danger that recoverable resources will be inconsistent with the 

coordinator system if the coordinator system has backed out. If the reason for the failure is the first of those listed above and if you wish CICS to ensure that 

data integrity is maintained, change the indoubt transaction definition to specify WAIT(YES) so that CICS automatically handles indoubt failures and 

resynchronizes the unit of work when the link to the coordinator system is reestablished.

 

Module:  DFHAPAC

 

ASPP

 

Explanation:  An intersystem session failed while a syncpoint was being taken. The intersystem session that failed was the link to the coordinator system, 

and the failure occurred during the critical indoubt period of syncpoint processing. As a result this CICS system is in doubt as to the outcome of the unit of 

work for the transaction.

 

The unit of work is not shunted to await the return of the coordinator system. Instead it is unilaterally backed out. The unit of work is not shunted for one of 

the following reasons:

 

   The transaction definition specifies WAIT(NO).

   The unit of work includes an MRO session to a back-level CICS system which does not support the WAIT(YES) option, and the role of the session in the

   The unit of work has updated a recoverable transient data destination, which is defined with WAIT(NO).

   The unit of work involves the installation of CICS resource definitions from the CSD (CICS system definition) file.

unit of work is backed out, rather than committed, because the transaction definition specifies ACTION(BACKOUT).

 

The fact that the unit of work is backed out is remembered by recovery manager (RM) domain until the unit of work is resynchronized with the coordinator 

system. At this time, according to whether the coordinator system backed out or committed, the recovery manager domain issues resynchronization 

messages reporting whether or not the resolution of the unit of work in the subordinate system was consistent with the coordinator system.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated. Recoverable resources updated by the unit of work are backed out and locks released. The EXEC 

CICS HANDLE ABEND command cannot handle this abend.

 

Message DFHAC2203 is sent to the terminal end user if possible, and message DFHAC2233 is sent to transient data destination CSMT.

 

User Response:  Any updates performed by the unit of work are backed out. There is a danger that recoverable resources will be inconsistent with the 

coordinator system if the coordinator system has committed. If the reason for the failure is the first of those listed above and if you wish CICS to ensure that 

data integrity is maintained, change the indoubt transaction definition to specify WAIT(YES) so that CICS automatically handles indoubt failures and 

resynchronizes the unit of work when the link to the coordinator system is reestablished.

 

Module:  DFHAPAC

 

ASPQ

 

Explanation:  During phase 2 of the two phase syncpoint protocol an error occurred while communicating with a remote system. The error occurred after the 

recoverable resources were committed or backed out, so data integrity is not in danger.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated. Recoverable resources updated by the unit of work will have backed out or committed depending 

on the decision taken by the recovery manager (RM) domain, which was not influenced by this later problem. The EXEC CICS HANDLE ABEND command 

cannot handle this abend.

 

Message DFHAC2221 is sent to the terminal end user if possible, and message DFHAC2251 is sent to transient data destination CSMT.

 

User Response:  Refer to earlier messages issued by the communication or remote resource management components of CICS to determine the cause of 

the intersystem communication problem.

 

Module:  DFHAPAC

 

ASPR

 

Explanation:  Intersystem communication failed while a syncpoint was being taken.  Communication with the coordinator system has been interrupted, and 

the failure occurred during the critical indoubt period of syncpoint processing.  As a result this CICS system is in doubt as to the outcome of the unit of work 

for the transaction.

 

However, this CICS system has not updated any recoverable resources in the unit of work and hence does not require the unit of work to be shunted to await 

resynchronization of its resources later. The coordinator system commits or backs out its resources. No resources on this system need to be kept in step.

 

This error can occur with external resource managers connected to CICS via the resource manager interface (RMI) as well as CICS systems connected via 

LU 6.2, and MRO. If an external resource manager such as DB2 is the only recoverable resource updated in the transaction, the recovery manager (RM) 

domain can optimize the syncpoint protocol. In this instance, the external resource manager becomes the syncpoint coordinator. If the link to the external 

resource manager is lost during this time, CICS will be indoubt as to whether the external resource manager updates were committed or backed out.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated. There are no recoverable resources affected in this CICS system. The EXEC CICS HANDLE 

ABEND command cannot handle this abend.

 

Message DFHAC2222 is sent to the terminal end user if possible, and message DFHAC2252 is sent to transient data destination CSMT.

 

User Response:  Refer to messages on the remote system to determine if the remote resources were backed out or committed.

 

Module:  DFHAPAC

 

ASP1

 

Explanation:  Intersystem communication failed while a syncpoint was being taken.  Communication with the coordinator system has been interrupted, and 

the failure occurred during the critical indoubt period of syncpoint processing.  As a result this CICS system is in doubt about the outcome of the unit of work 

for the transaction.

 

Alternatively, a transaction may have timed out while waiting for Recoverable Resource Management Services (RRMS) to provide the outcome of the unit of 

work, or RRMS may have failed during the critical indoubt period.

 

The transaction definition specifies WAIT(YES) as an indoubt attribute. Therefore the unit of work is not completed but is shunted and allowed to wait for 

resynchronization with the coordinator system. If the WAITTIME attribute is specified on the transaction definition, the unit of work waits for the specified 

time. If after that time the coordinator system has not resynchronized, a unilateral decision is made about the unit of work as specified by the ACTION 

keyword on the transaction definition. A WAITTIME of zero, the default, means an indefinite wait. The unit of work can also be forced to take a unilateral 

decision by means of a CEMT SET UOW command.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated. The EXEC CICS HANDLE ABEND command cannot handle this abend.

 

The associated unit of work is shunted awaiting the return of the coordinator system. Recoverable resources updated by the unit of work remain locked. The 

locks are released when the unit of work is backed out or committed at resynchronization time, or when a unilateral decision is made by this system.

 

Message DFHAC2201 is sent to the terminal end user if possible, and message DFHAC2231 is sent to transient data destination CSMT.

 

User Response:  None. Any updates performed by the unit of work are resolved automatically when resynchronization with the coordinator system takes 

place.

 

Alternatively, the user can force resolution of the updates independently of the coordinator system by making a CEMT request to commit or back out the unit 

of work.

 

Module:  DFHAPAC o*---------- ABCODE ASP2 ALTERED BY APAR PQ47569 ----------------

 

ASP2

 

Explanation:  A syncpoint has been attempted when an intersystem conversation is in a state in which the EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT command is not 

allowed. If CICS is connected to a system which must act as LAST AGENT, such as IMS, then this ABEND will be issued from SYNCPOINT processing if a 

PREPARE has been received on a link to another system. In order to support syncpointing CICS must act as COORDINATOR when it is directly connected 

to the LAST AGENT, the COORDINATOR system may send PREPARE syncpoint commands but never receives them.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump which includes terminal control information. In particular, the dump 

contains state information for the links used by this transaction. The EXEC CICS HANDLE ABEND command cannot handle this abend.

 

User Response:  Ensure that the application issues an EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT command only when its sync level 2 conversations are in the correct state. 

The EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT command may be issued only when each conversation is in one of the following states:

 

    SEND

    PEND-RECEIVE (Not for MRO)

    PEND-FREE

    SYNC-RECEIVE

    SYNC-SEND (Not for MRO)

    SYNC-FREE

 

Module:  DFHAPAC

 

ASP3

 

Explanation:  An application has requested syncpoint, either via EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT or implicitly via EXEC CICS RETURN. The coordinator of the 

syncpoint is not this CICS system but is remote. During the syncpoint protocol the remote coordinator has decided that the unit of work cannot be committed 

and must be backed out.

 

This error can occur with external resource managers connected to CICS via the resource manager interface (RMI) as well as CICS systems connected via 

LU 6.2, and MRO. If an external resource manager such as DB2 is the only recoverable resource updated in the transaction, the recovery manager (RM) 

domain can optimize the syncpoint protocol. In this instance, the external resource manager becomes the syncpoint coordinator. In this instance if the 

external resource manager returns with a backed out response, an ASP3 abend results.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated and recoverable resources updated by the unit of work are backed out. The EXEC CICS HANDLE 

ABEND command cannot handle this abend.

 

Message DFHAC2220 is sent to the terminal end user if possible, and message DFHAC2250 is sent to transient data destination CSMT.

 

User Response:  Refer to the remote coordinator system to determine why the unit of work was backed out.

 

Module:  DFHAPAC

 

ASP7

 

Explanation:  A resource manager involved in syncpoint protocols has replied 'No' to a request to 'Prepare'. The resource manager may be local to this CICS 

system, or may be a remote resource manager on another CICS system, or an external resource manager communicating through the resource manager 

interface (RMI).

 

System Action:  CICS terminates the transaction abnormally. Recoverable resources updated by the unit of work are backed out. The EXEC CICS HANDLE 

ABEND command cannot handle this abend.

 

If it is a local resource manager that has voted no, message DFHAC2218 is sent to the terminal end user if possible, and message DFHAC2248 is sent to 

transient data destination CSMT.

 

If it is a remote resource manager that has voted no, message DFHAC2219 is sent to the terminal end user if possible, and message DFHAC2249 is sent to 

transient data destination CSMT.

 

User Response:  This abend is caused by a prior problem. For example, the resource manager cannot flush its buffers because of an I/O error, or it cannot 

communicate with CICS because of a TP failure. Correct the earlier problem. An ASP7 can also occur during terminal or connection install if CICS is short on 

storage.  For instance if message DFHAC2248 shows the transaction as CATA then look for earlier short on storage messages.

 

Module:  DFHAPAC

 

ASP8

 

Explanation:  The transaction requested syncpoint rollback, but was using a type of processing for which syncpoint rollback is not supported.

 

System Action:  CICS terminates the transaction abnormally. The EXEC CICS HANDLE ABEND command cannot handle this abend.

 

Message DFHAC2217 is sent to the terminal end user if possible, and message DFHAC2247 is sent to transient data destination CSMT.

 

User Response:  This error may be an application error or a configuration error. Some communication sessions, (for example, LU6.1) do not support 

syncpoint rollback, and if CICS detects such a session during rollback processing, the task is abended. This restriction is described in the CICS 

Intercommunication Guide. To resolve the problem, either:

 

   Change the application so that it does not issue syncpoint rollback commands while the non-supporting sessions are allocated (e.g. issue an EXEC 

 

    CICS FREE first), or

 

   Change the configuration so that either APPC or MRO sessions are used for communication. These are the only two session types which support 

 

    syncpoint rollback.

 

 

Alternatively, following a session failure during a previous syncpoint, CICS may have decided to rollback this unit-of-work in order to preserve data integrity. 

Since the unit-of-work contains a session which does not support syncpoint rollback, this abend ensues. In this case, no action is required in response to 

this abend, although action may be required to deal with the original failure.

 

Module:  DFHAPAC

 

ASP9

 

Explanation:  The transaction requested syncpoint via EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT, but this is not allowed in a transaction that is acting on behalf of an Activity.

 

System Action:  CICS terminates the transaction abnormally. EXEC CICS HANDLE ABEND command cannot handle this abend.

 

User Response:  The error indicates an invalid attempt to syncpoint the transaction.

 

Module:  DFHEISP

 

ASQA

 

Explanation:  The CLS2 transaction was processing resynchronization work but the communications session which it was using has failed.

 

System Action:  The work is reexecuted on a new session. If reexecution has has already been attempted, the transaction terminates.

 

User Response:  The error may be caused by the failure of several sessions between communicating systems during the resynchronization process. To 

confirm this, examine the CSMT transient data queue for the relevant period.

 

Another cause could be logic errors within the resynchronization program, either on this system or on the partner system, which caused the session to be 

terminated. In this case, CSMT transient data messages indicate the nature of the error.

 

Module:  DFHCRRSY

 

ASQB

 

Explanation:  The CLS2 transaction was executing exchange log names or resynchronization with a remote system when a logic error occurred.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a transaction dump.

User Response:  You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to 

proceed.

 

Module:  DFHCRRSY

 

ASQC

 

Explanation:  The CLS2 transaction was attached with an unexpected start code. The transaction can be attached due to terminal input (on a 

communications session), or via a system attach. Neither of these methods was used.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated.

 

User Response:  The error indicates an invalid attempt to start the transaction.

 

Module:  DFHCRRSY

 

ASQD

 

Explanation:  The CLS2 transaction was attached but could not use the transaction manager interface to obtain input parameters.

Explanation:  The CLS2 transaction was executing exchange log names with a remote system and 3 retry attempts have failed to solicit a warm exchange 

log names reply, in response to a warm exchange log names request sent by CICS.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  This abend indicates an error in the remote system. It should have saved the log name sent by CICS and, on receiving a later exchange 

lognames request, should then respond with a warm reply.

 

Module:  DFHCRRSY

 

ASQG

 

Explanation:  The CLS2 transaction was executing resynchronization work and has failed during the receipt of data from remote system via an MRO 

session. The data was longer than expected.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  The abend indicates a CICS logic error, possibly in the remote system. The transaction storage in the dump shows the data received. The 

transaction trace shows the preceding flows between the systems, which should match those documented in the SNA LU6.2 Reference: Peer Protocols 

manual, SC30-6808.

ASQK

 

Explanation:  The CLS2 transaction was processing exchange lognames or resynchronization for a connected partner identified by a netname. The 

connection entry associated with the netname was located and locked, but could not be unlocked in subsequent processing. This indicates a CICS internal 

logic error.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnomally terminated with a transaction dump.

 

Message DFHRS2156 may also issued.

 

User Response:  This indicates an error either in the CICS table manager, (which may have produced its own exception trace records) or in the 

resynchronization program itself. Look at the trace records and the CSMT message log for further information which might have indicated an error in the table 

manager program or in the table entry for the connection. You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem

Explanation:  A CICS internal logic error has occurred in the management of dynamic storage for the resynchronization program.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  This indicates that the resynchronization program has exhausted the available space for recording storage areas. The symptoms may 

indicate that the program was looping without executing the error recovery process. You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 

of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to proceed.

ASRA

 

Explanation:  The task has terminated abnormally because of a program check.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated and CICS issues either message DFHAP0001 or DFHSR0001. Message DFHSR0622 may also be 

issued.

 

User Response:  Refer to the description of the associated message or messages to determine and correct the cause of the program check.

Explanation:  An operating system abend has occurred and CICS has been able to abend the current transaction.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated and CICS issues either message DFHAP0001 or DFHSR0001

 

User Response:  Refer to the description of the associated message to determine the cause of the original operating system abend, and take the necessary 

corrective action.

 

Module:  DFHSRP

 

ASRD

 

Explanation:  The task has been abnormally terminated for one of these reasons:

 

   A program contains an assembler macro call which is no longer supported by CICS.

   An invalid attempt has been made to access the CSA or TCA. This abend could be caused by an attempt to address the CSA through OS/VS COBOL 

 

    BLL cells. For example:

 

    When an OS/VS COBOL program is invoked by CICS for MVS, CICS inserts the address of the fetch-protected dummy CSA into the first of the 

    application-managed BLL cells. If an attempt is made to access this storage before the application has reinitialized the BLL cell, abend ASRD will occur.

 

   A non-assembler program has been wrongly defined to CICS as an assembler program.

 

 

 

This error appears as a program check.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated and CICS issues message DFHSR0618, followed by either DFHAP0001 or DFHSR0001.

 

User Response:  Refer to the description of the associated messages to determine and correct the error.

 

It is likely that either R12 which usually addresses the TCA or R13 which usually addresses the CSA is pointing to an area of storage that you are not 

allowed to access.

Module:  DFHSRP

 

ASRE

 

Explanation:  The task has been abnormally terminated because an attempt has been made to access a CICS-DB2 RCT load module.

 

The RCT nolonger exists as a load module and cannot be accessed directly.

 

To access information held in the RCT use the CICS SPI commands EXEC CICS INQUIRE/SET DB2CONN, EXEC CICS INQUIRE/SET DB2ENTRY and 

EXEC CICS INQUIRE/SET DB2TRAN.

 

This error appears as a program check.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated and CICS issues message DFHSR0619, followed by either DFHAP0001 or DFHSR0001.

 

User Response:  Change the application to use the CICS SPI commands to retrieve data from, or set fields in, the RCT.

Explanation:  The AP domain recovery stub, DFHSR1, has been invoked to deal with a program check, operating system abend, or another error within a 

transaction environment. However, DFHSR1 has been unable to call the system recovery program, DFHSRP, because register 12, which should be pointing 

to the task control area (TCA), is null. This indicates that the caller of DFHSR1, has not set the address of the TCA..

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to 

proceed.

 

Module:  DFHSR1

 

ATCA

 

Explanation:  The system was in a final quiesce mode when the CICS application program issued a DFHTC macro.

 

System Action:  The task requesting the I/O is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  None.

 

Module:  DFHZARQ

 

ATCB

 

Explanation:  The CICS application program issued two consecutive DFHTC writes or two consecutive DFHTC reads, but in either case did not issue an 

intervening wait.

 

Problem Determination:  A transaction dump is provided with this abend. In the dump, register 12 addresses the current TCA, and register 10 and the field 

TCAFCAAA address the TCTTE associated with this task. In TCATPOS2, bit TCATPOWR (X'01') indicates that a write is requested by the DFHTC macro, 

and bit TCATPORR (X'10') indicates that a read is requested. In TCTTEOS, bit TCTTEOWR (X'01') indicates that a write is in progress, and bit TCTTEORR 

(X'10') indicates that a read is in progress.

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Take corrective action within the program being executed.

 

This is almost certainly an application program error. Determine the flow of control through the application and determine why an intervening wait is not 

issued. The trace table may be useful to discover where the application is issuing the read and write requests. If necessary, start trace or auxiliary trace 

using the master terminal command and rerun the transaction to obtain a trace. The output of the auxiliary trace can be printed using the trace utility 

program, DFHTU620.

ATCC

 

Explanation:  An application program, using a pipeline session, has either issued more than one write request or issued a read request.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Correct the application program so that it will not issue more than one consecutive WRITE to a pipeline session terminal.

 

Module:  DFHZARQ

 

 

 

 

ATCD

 

Explanation:  This abend code is used whenever a CTYPE request or a QUEUE request is issued and VTAM or a ZCP function has not been included in the 

system.

 

It is also used to abend a task that issues an APPC command when the CICS system is not at a level to support APPC.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Correct the transaction so that it does not issue a CTYPE macro instruction if VTAM is not generated into the system, or include the ZCP 

function for which the CTYPE or QUEUE request was issued.

 

Modules: DFHZDSP, DFHZERH

 

 

 

 

ATCE

 

Explanation:  A CICS application program has issued a DFHTC request without specifying the address of a TIOA, but the request is not an ERASE ALL 

UNPROTECTED or a READBUF request for a 3270 data stream terminal.

 

Problem Determination:  A transaction dump is provided with this abend. In the dump, register 12 addresses the current TCA, and register 10 and the field 

TCAFCAAA addresses the TCTTE associated with this task. Register 8 and TCTTEDA should contain the address of the TIOA to be used in the I/O request, 

but actually they contain zero. For a 3270 data stream terminal, byte TCTETDST has bit TCTETTSI (X'01') set. An erase-all-unprotected request is indicated 

by the setting of bit TCTTEEUI (X'40') in byte TCTTEEUB, and a read buffer request is indicated by the setting of bit TCTTERBI (X'80') in byte TCTTERBB.

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Correct the error in the user program by ensuring that a terminal input/output area (TIOA) is provided at write time.

 

This is almost certainly an application program error. Determine the flow of control through the application and determine why a TIOA has not been specified.

ATCF

 

Explanation:  A DFHTC CTYPE macro was issued to a non-VTAM terminal control table terminal entry (TCTTE), or a DFHTC CTYPE=COMMAND or 

RESPONSE macro was issued to a VTAM 3270 TCTTE.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Ensure that the program issues CTYPE macros to VTAM terminals only, and does not issue CTYPE=COMMAND or RESPONSE to a 

VTAM 3270.

 

Module:  DFHZCRQ

 

ATCG

 

Explanation:  A CICS application program has issued a DFHTC request for a terminal that it does not own. The problem of ownership may be because the 

task previously issued a WRITE,LAST request (which would have detached the terminal from that task) or because the task incorrectly specified the terminal 

to which the request is directed.

 

Problem Determination:  Register 12 addresses the current TCA and register 10 contains the address of the TCTTE. The address of the TCTTE was 

obtained either from TCAFCAAA in the case of a non-ISC transaction, or from TCATPTA if bit TCATPTTA (X'40') is on in byte TCATPOC3 (this indicates that 

TERM=YES was specified on the DFHTC request and that this is an ISC transaction). In the TCTTE thus located, the field TCTTECA does not contain the 

address of the TCA, indicating that this TCA is not owned by this task.

 

Analysis: A DFHTC request has been issued specifying a TCTTE in which the field TCTTECA does not contain the address of the TCA.

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  This is most probably an application error (unless storage has been completely overwritten). Determine the flow from the trace table and 

when a request to the DFHZCP detach routine, DFHZDET, or a DFHTC WRITE,LAST was issued.

 

Module:  DFHZARQ

 

 

 

 

ATCH

 

Explanation:  The task was purged before a domain call was able to complete successfully.  The task that first detected the purged condition provides an 

exception trace.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Investigate why the task was purged. It was purged either as a result of a purge from the master terminal operator via the CEMT 

transaction, or by the task being timed out after waiting for longer than the DTIMOUT (deadlock timeout) value specified for the transaction, or by CICS 

issuing a purge request.

 

If the master terminal operator purged the task, this may have been in an attempt to clear the system which appeared to be deadlocked for some reason.

 

If the task was timed out automatically as a result of the DTIMOUT value being exceeded, this may be due to insufficient main storage being available for the 

number of tasks in the system. If the amount of main storage cannot be increased, reduce the number of tasks in the system to avoid short-on-storage 

situations. Another possibility is to increase the value of the DTIMOUT option for the transaction.

 

When CICS purges a task, it does so to allow an operation to complete which would be held up by the presence of active tasks, or to ensure data integrity.  

For example, CICS will purge a task which has made recoverable updates to a coupling facility data table if it determines that the coupling facility data table 

server for the pool in which that table resides has recycled, to ensure that all updates in the unit of work will be backed out.

  The address of the AWE (TCAFCAAA) is 0

   The AWE is invalid (TCTWETYP should be TCTTEAWE)

   An abend is issued early in DFHZATA.

This abend is issued by DFHZATD in the following circumstances:

    Transaction CATD is issued from a terminal

   The address of the AWE (TCAFCAAA) is 0

   An abend is issued early in DFHZATD.

This abend is issued by DFHZATR in the following circumstances:

    Transaction CATR is issued from a terminal

   An abend is issued early in DFHZATD.

 

System Action:  CICS rejects the request.

 

User Response:  Determine the issuing program and the reason for the abend and take the appropriate action as follows:

 

Do not try to invoke CATA, CATD or CATR from a terminal.

 

If the address in TCAFCAAA is incorrect, the calling mechanism has failed. This is a CICS logic error.

 

If an abend has been issued, use the transaction dump to determine where the abend occurred. This is a CICS logic error.

ATCO

 

Explanation:  An application program has attempted to perform a function not supported by a terminal or system.

 

Possible errors are:

 

1.  SIGNAL not supported.

 

    A DFHTC TYPE=SIGNAL request with the WAIT=YES option was issued to a VTAM logical unit that CICS does not support for the receipt of the SIGNAL 

    indicator.

 

2.  WRITE STRUCTURED FIELD not supported.

 

    This write may have been attempted as a result of a SEND command with the STRFIELD keyword to a device that does not support this function.

 

3.  APPC mapped conversation not supported.

 

    The application has attempted to perform a normal terminal control command on a session that is in use for an APPC unmapped conversation. (Only 

    EXEC CICS GDS commands are permitted.)

 

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Correct the application program.

 

Module:  DFHZARQ

 

ATCQ

 

Explanation:  The application program issued a write operation to a terminal that was in send status. In order to allow this write to proceed, a signal 

command was sent, and DFHZCP started to read data from the terminal waiting for the change direction indication. As each data record is received, it is 

placed on temporary storage and, for one of these operations, a temporary storage error has occurred.

 

Problem Determination:  Register 12 addresses the current TCA. TCACCSV1 contains a saved copy of TCATSTR containing the temporary storage 

response code. The temporary storage response code may be one of:

 

  X'04' - IOERROR - I/O error

  X'08' - NOSPACE - No temporary storage space

  X'20' - INVREQ  - Invalid request.

 

The temporary storage identification is constructed by concatenating the character string "DFHQ" with the terminal identification from TCTTETI. The 

temporary storage identification is placed in TCATSDI.

 

Register 8 and field TCTTEDA address the TIOA that is being written to temporary storage. The address passed to temporary storage is that of TIOATDL.

 

Analysis: After the DFHTS TYPE=PUTQ, the temporary storage response code was not zero.

 

  Register  Label    Description

 

  R12=@TCA  ZRAQ60   TCATSTR is nonzero.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Check that temporary storage has been included in the system and that it has sufficient space.

 

If an invalid request is indicated, check that the length of the data being written to temporary storage is not greater than the VSAM control interval size minus 

84. The length of the data is in TIOATDL (which is 8 greater than the length of the data that is read in by DFHZCP).

 

Module:  DFHZRAQ

 

ATCR

 

Explanation:  An application program has issued a read operation, after a previous write operation has caused DFHZCP to read-ahead data from the terminal 

in order to avoid a lock-out. DFHZCP has now issued a DFHTS GETQ to retrieve the saved data from temporary storage, and an error has occurred.

 

Problem Determination:  Register 12 addresses the current TCA. TCACCSV1 contains a saved copy of TCATSTR that contains the temporary storage 

response code. The temporary storage response code may be one of:

 

  X'01' - ENERROR - Entry error

  X'02' - IDERROR - Identification error

  X'04' - IOERROR - I/O error

  X'20' - INVREQ  - Invalid request

 

The temporary storage identification is constructed by concatenating the character string "DFHQ" with the terminal identification from TCTTETI. The 

temporary storage identification is placed in TCATSDI.

 

Analysis: After the DFHTS TYPE=GETQ, the temporary storage response code was not zero.

 

  Register   Label    Description

 

  R12=@TCA   ZRAR90   TCATSTR is not zero.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Determine the cause of the temporary storage error and correct it.

 

If a temporary storage identification error is indicated, examine TCTTETI for a valid terminal identification.

ATCU

 

Explanation:  An application program attempted to send data to a logical unit, but was in receive mode (EIBRECV is set), and read-ahead queuing was not 

specified in installed profile definition (RAQ=NO).

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Either change the application program to issue receives until EIBRECV is not set, or specify RAQ=YES in the installed profile definition (If 

RAQ=YES is specified, ensure that all input messages are read before the transaction is terminated.)

 

Module:  DFHZARQ

 

 

 

 

ATCV

 

Explanation:  An application attempted an operation on a logical unit, but was not in the correct mode for one of the following reasons:

 

1.  When issued by DFHZARQ, CICS cannot perform the current request because another request is outstanding (EIBSYNC is set). This holds for APPC or 

    non-APPC systems

 

2.  When issued by DFHETL, the application is communicating with an APPC system, and is not in the correct state to perform the attempted operation.  

    This holds for APPC systems only

 

3.  When issued by DFHZISP, a TCTTE free was requested, and there is an outstanding sync point request. This holds for non-APPC systems only

 

4.  When issued by DFHZISP, a TCTTE free was requested, the TCTTE is in receive mode, and RAQ=NO was specified in the installed profile definition.  This 

    holds for non-APPC systems only.

 

 

Problem Determination:  Register 12 addresses the current TCA. Register 10 and field TCAFCAAA address TCTTE. The terminal byte TCTTECRE has bit 

TCTEUCOM (X'02') set if sync point is required, and TCTEUFRT (X'04') set if Free Session is required; TCTESMDI has TCTEUSMD (X'02') set if the 

application is in SEND mode. TCTERCVI has TCTEURCV (X'01') set if the application is in RECEIVE mode. Bit TCTESRAQ (X'80') in byte TCTEIRAQ 

indicates that read-ahead queuing is coded on the installed profile definition for this transaction.

 

The type-of-request bits in the TCA are set as follows:

 

  TCATPOS1 TCATPIS (X'01') Signal requested.

 

 

    -   TCATPFRE (X'03') Free TCTTE.

 


   TCATPOS2 TCATPORR (X'10') Receive requested.

 

 

    -   TCATPOWR (X'01') Send requested.

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  The response depends on the reason for the error as follows:

 

1.  Issue a sync point and then issue the request.

2.  Issue the free request and reallocate the session.

3.  Either change the application to issue receives until EIBRECV is not set, or specify RAQ=YES in the installed profile definition. (If you specify RAQ=YES 

    in the installed profile definition, ensure that all input messages are read before the transaction is terminated.)

4.  See the CICS Distributed Transaction Programming Guide where rules for the correct use of commands are given. Then correct the application.

 

The application program has attempted an operation on a logical unit that is invalid, because the program's current status on the session with that logical unit 

does not permit it. An investigation of the TCTTE (that is, Session), status bytes, and TCA type of request bytes will reveal which of the above problems are 

relevant.

 

When the cause of the problem has been ascertained, the application program should be changed to ensure that the session-oriented information is acted 

upon before any further requests are sent across that session. The session status information is made available to the application program in the exec 

interface block (EIB) immediately following the execution of RECEIVE, CONVERSE, or RETRIEVE requests across the session. The relevant bytes must be 

tested, strictly in the order shown, and acted upon, before any further operations are attempted on the session. In addition, the status information bytes 

themselves are necessarily volatile in that they are reset before the execution of every EXEC CICS... statement. Thus it is good programming practice to save 

them into application user storage after a RECEIVE, CONVERSE, or RETRIEVE for later testing. The states are:

 

1. EIBSYNC  the application must take a syncpoint

 

2. EIBFREE  the application must free the session (or terminate when the session will be freed automatically)

 

3. EIBRECV  the application must continue receiving data by issuing further RECEIVE commands; by definition, data cannot be sent while in this state.

 

 

Some of these status tests can sometimes be omitted (for example, testing of the EIBSYNC status is not essential if it is known that the application program 

on the remote system never issues sync point requests itself). However, the tests should always be carried out, particularly if the remote application might be 

amended at a future date, in which event the session handling logic may well be altered. Also, it may be that the remote transaction itself causes an 

unsuspected flow on the session. For example, if the remote program issues EXEC CICS SEND..... LAST across the session, followed by RETURN, a 

syncpoint request (RQD2) will be added onto the transmitted data. (The application programmer is referred to the CICS Distributed Transaction Programming 

Guide for a discussion of this topic). As a result of this addition, an unsuspected syncpoint request is received by the local application, which abend if the 

session is freed without the sync point request being honored.

 

Note:  An ATCV abend is also raised by module DFHETL if a state error occurs during processing of an APPC mapped application (that is, the program 

       attempts to perform an operation while in the wrong state). The handling of APPC mapped applications is described in the CICS Diagnosis Reference. 

       Some commands are processed by DFHZARQ, as above, and others by various other modules invoked by DFHETL. Rules for using commands for 

       APPC are given in the CICS Distributed Transaction Programming Guide. Reference to this guide should reveal the programming error.

Explanation:  An error has occurred during the processing of an inbound function management header (FMH). Either a length error has been detected, for 

example, incomplete FMH received, or an invalid field has been detected within the FMH.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Notify the system programmer of the error. The problem is probably in the remote system that has sent the invalid FMH.

 

If the inbound FMH is from a system with an earlier release of CICS then you may need to set USEDFLTUSER. See 'Attach Time Security and the

Explanation:  The CICS terminal control restart task could not complete because a necessary step failed. The task has done some essential recovery 

operations and abnormally terminated itself with code ATC1.

 

System Action:  CICS writes a transaction dump for the terminal control restart task.

 

CICS sends two messages to the console, one to identify the error detected by the terminal control restart task, and DFHTC1001 to report that the task has 

failed. A third message follows either to say that CICS has terminated abnormally with a dump, or to ask you to reply GO or CANCEL. Depending on the 

nature of the original error, you may see messages from some other system component (for example, an access method).

 

User Response:  First, if CICS has requested a response, you must reply. If you reply 'GO', CICS continues processing, but without terminal control. If you 

reply 'CANCEL', CICS terminates abnormally with a dump.

 

Use the messages and dumps to find out the cause of the failure.

 

Module:  DFHTCRP

 

ATC2

 

Explanation:  A CICS SET VTAM OPEN command has failed due to VTAM rejecting a CICS request.

 

System Action:  Message DFHZC2302, DFHZC2304 or DFHZC2307 is sent to the console, and CICS terminates the transaction abnormally with a 

transaction dump.

 

User Response:  The RPL with the VTAM request code and return code can be found in the RA pool addressed from TCTVRVRA. Use the VTAM 

Programming manual, to determine the cause of the error and the actions necessary to correct it.  After correcting the error, either retry the request or 

terminate CICS and restart the network in your own time.

 

Module:  DFHZSLS

 

 

 

 

ATC3

 

Explanation:  A write to a TLX device was issued with a data length of 0 causing TIOA data length (TIOATDL) to be zero.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:

 

For an error writing to a TLX device correct the error in the user program by ensuring that a data length for data to be placed in the terminal input/output area 

(TIOA) is provided at write time.

 

Modules: DFHZARL DFHZARQ

 

 

 

 

ATC4

 

Explanation:  A serious CAVM error has occurred. The XRF TCB has abended.

 

System Action:  CICS abnormally terminates with a system dump.

 

User Response:  Use the dump and the guidance in any messages issued by other system components to diagnose and correct the original error.

 

See the CICS Problem Determination Guide for further guidance on using system dumps.

 

Module:  DFHTCRP

 

ATC5

 

Explanation:  An internal logic error has been detected during APPC mapped processing. The conversation state maintained by DFHZARL does not match 

the state which is jointly maintained by DFHETL and DFHZARM.

 

This problem could also arise when CICS is receiving application data. CICS may receive and end of chain notification before receiving all the data expected.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. CICS processing continues.

 

User Response:  You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to 

proceed.

 

Module:  DFHETL

 

ATC6

 

Explanation:  DFHETL has a SEND DATA request with a data length greater than 65 528 bytes which is the maximum that it can process.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  This is a CICS internal logic error. You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem 

Determination Guide for guidance on how to proceed.

 

Module:  DFHETL

 

ATC7

 

Explanation:  DFHZSUP has detected a bad response from an INITIAL-CALL request to DFHZARL.  This response is returned to DFHZSUP in the DFHLUC 

parameter list.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Examine field LUCCDRCD in the DFHLUC parameter list. This appears in the ENTRY/EXIT trace points for DFHZARL. If trace is switched 

off, then it can be found in DFHZSUP's LIFO entry in the transaction dump.

 


   LUCCDRCD = 'A0000100' - session failure

 


   LUCCDRCD = 'A0010100' - read timeout

 


   LUCCDRCD = 'A0010000' - deadlock timeout.

 

 

(The offset for LUCCDRCD can be found in CICS Data Areas).

 

If LUCCDRCD is X'00000000', the error is the result of a connection failure. In this case examine the CSMT log for further diagnostic information.

 

Module:  DFHZSUP

 

ATC8

 

Explanation:  An error has occurred during the processing of an inbound function management header (FMH). Either a length error has been detected, for 

example, incomplete FMH received, or an invalid field has been detected within the FMH.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Notify the system programmer of the error. The problem is probably in the remote system that has sent the invalid FMH.

 

Module:  DFHETL

 

ATC9

 

Explanation:  A DFHKC RESUME macro call has been issued for a task without first issuing DFHKC SUSPEND. DFHKC RESUME must be preceded by 

DFHKC SUSPEND.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Examine the trace entry to locate the error.

 

Module:  DFHZNCE

 

ATDC

 

Explanation:  A transaction has issued an EXEC CICS READQ, WRITEQ or DELETEQ command against a logically recoverable transient data queue. The 

task was enqueued because another task currently owns the enqueue. While waiting to obtain the enqueue, the task was purged.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Investigate why the transaction was purged. It may have been purged via CEMT or automatically, by DTIMEOUT for example.

 

Module:  DFHETD

 

ATDY

 

Explanation:  Transient data initialization has failed. A console message, DFH12xx, gives the reason for the failure.

 

System Action:  Transient data initialization terminates abnormally. This abend is always followed by an ATDZ abend for the failing function, and by 

message DFHSI1521 (if CICS abends unconditionally), or message DFHSI1522, which prompts you to reply GO or CANCEL.

 

User Response:  See the associated console message for information regarding the cause of the failure. Then respond to message DFHSI1522, if it has 

been issued.

 

Module:  DFHTDRP

 

ATDZ

 

Explanation:  A CICS function invoked by transient data initialization has failed. If the failing function is a transient data routine, this abend is preceded by a 

console message and an ATDY abend.

 

System Action:  Transient data initialization terminates abnormally. This abend is always followed by message DFHSI1521 (if CICS abends unconditionally), 

or message DFHSI1522, which asks you to reply GO or CANCEL.

 

User Response:  Refer to the associated console message for further information regarding the cause of the failure. Then respond to message DFHSI1522, if 

it has been issued.

 

Module:  DFHTDRP

 

ATFE

 

Explanation:  A FREEMAIN request to the storage manager has failed while CICS was executing a CEDA CHECK or CEDA INSTALL command.

 

System Action:  CICS abnormally terminates the task with a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Use the dump and any associated messages issued by the storage manager to investigate the FREEMAIN failure.

 

Module:  DFHTOUT1

 

ATGE

 

Explanation:  A GETMAIN request to the storage manager has failed while CICS was executing a CEDA CHECK or CEDA INSTALL command.

 

System Action:  CICS abnormally terminates the task with a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Use the dump and any associated messages issued by the storage manager to investigate the GETMAIN failure.

 

Module:  DFHTOUT1

 

ATMA

 

Explanation:  The task was purged before a GETMAIN request to the storage manager (SM) domain was able to complete successfully. The domain that 

first detected the purged condition will have provided an exception trace.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Investigate why the task was purged. It was purged either as a result of a purge from the master terminal operator via the CEMT 

transaction, or by the task being timed out after waiting for longer than the DTIMOUT (deadlock timeout) value specified for the transaction, or by CICS 

issuing a purge request.

 

If the master terminal operator purged the task, this may have been in an attempt to clear the system which appeared to be deadlocked for some reason.

 

If the task was timed out automatically as a result of the DTIMOUT value being exceeded, this may be due to insufficient main storage being available for the 

number of tasks in the system. If the amount of main storage cannot be increased, reduce the number of tasks in the system to avoid short-on-storage 

situations. Another possibility is to increase the value of the DTIMOUT option for the transaction.

 

When CICS purges a task, it does so to allow an operation to complete which would be held up by the presence of active tasks.

 

Module:  DFHTMP

 

ATMB

 

Explanation:  An error (INVALID, DISASTER or unexpected EXCEPTION response) has occurred on a call to the storage manager (SM) domain. The 

domain that detected the original error will have provided an exception trace, a console message and, possibly, a system dump (depending on the options 

specified in the dump table).

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  See the related message from the domain that detected the original error.

 

Module:  DFHTMP

 

ATNA

 

Explanation:  A terminal operator entered the transaction identification for NACP.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Do not reenter the NACP transaction identification (CSNE).

 

Module:  DFHZNAC

 

ATNB

 

Explanation:  The application program has issued a terminal control request for a terminal for which a previous request was terminated with an abend AZCT, 

because of a read timeout condition. The terminal control blocks are not in a fit state to allow a new request to be processed.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Change the application program to issue an abend when handling an abend AZCT.

 

Module:  DFHZARQ

 

ATNC

 

Explanation:  The application program has issued a terminal control request for a terminal for which a previous terminal control request was terminated with 

an abend ATCH, because the task was purged. The terminal control blocks are not in a fit state to allow a new request to be processed.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Change the application program to issue an abend when handling an abend ATCH.

 

Module:  DFHZARQ

 

 

 

 

ATND

 

Explanation:  The node error program (NEP) or NACP decides that a task should abnormally terminate, but the task is at a critical point of processing and 

immediate termination would put the integrity of the system at risk.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump when the task next requests any action against the terminal, or issues a 

sync point request involving the terminal.

 

User Response:  Check destination CSMT for possible further information. Use the dump to determine why the task was abnormally terminated by NEP.

 

Modules: DFHZARQ, DFHZARL, DFHZSUP

 

ATNI

 

Explanation:  There are two forms of this abend:

 

VTAM form

  The node error program (NEP) or NACP decides the task should be abnormally terminated. DFHZNAC informs the request module to abend the transaction 

  after the TC unit has completed.

Non-VTAM form

  The terminal error program (TEP) or terminal abnormal condition program (TACP) decides the task should be abnormally terminated. DFHTACP informs 

  DFHZARQ to abend the transaction after the TC unit has completed.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  This usually occurs when, due to a hardware failure, a network device rejects the data stream sent to it. The device itself may indicate an 

error code that will give a specific reason for the rejection. Check the CSMT log for further information.

 

This abend can also result from an error in a connected system such as a mirror transaction abend.

 

Abend ATNI can occur if a user application does not correctly handle an error return code from an external resource manager, such as DB2.

 

For the NEP (VTAM) form, run a VTAM trace type=BUF for the logical unit and repeat the error.

 

For the TEP (non-VTAM) form, run a link trace for the line or local channel address for the device.

 

Examine the data stream and error response to determine the cause of the error.

 

This type of error occurs if the definitions in the TCT do not match the attributes of the actual device.

Program. The value of UERCPURG is defined by the macro DFHUEXIT TYPE=EP, ID=xxxxxxxx, where xxxxxxxx is the exit point by which the exit 

program is enabled. This code does not apply to exit points in domains. The exit program returns this value when it has made a request for CICS services 

using the exit programming Interface (XPI) and when the XPI call has had a RESPONSE code of PURGED. Exit programs must not set UERCPURG return 

code under any other circumstance.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

Module:  DFHXFP

 

AXF4

 

Explanation:  The task was purged before a GET_BUFFER request to the EXEC interface service routines module (DFHEISR), was able to complete 

successfully. The domain that first detected the purged condition provides an exception trace.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Investigate why the task was purged. It was purged either as a result of a purge from the master terminal operator via the CEMT 

transaction, or by the task being timed out after waiting for longer than the DTIMOUT (deadlock timeout) value specified for the transaction.

 

If the master terminal operator purged the task, this may have been in an attempt to clear the system which appeared to be deadlocked for some reason.

 

If the task was timed out automatically as a result of the DTIMOUT value being exceeded, this may be due to insufficient main storage being available for the 

number of tasks in the system. If the amount of main storage cannot be increased, reduce the number of tasks in the system to avoid short-on-storage 

situations. Another possibility is to increase the value of the DTIMOUT option for the transaction.

 

Module:  DFHXFX

 

AXF5

 

Explanation:  An error (INVALID, DISASTER, or unexpected EXCEPTION response) has occurred on a call to the EXEC interface service routines

Module:  DFHXMTA

 

AXSA

 

Explanation:  The CICS security control task could not complete because a necessary step failed. The task has done some essential recovery operations 

and abnormally terminated itself with code AXSA.

 

System Action:  CICS writes a transaction dump for the security control restart task.

 

CICS sends messages to the console, one to identify the error detected by the security control task, and, if the error occurred during initialization, one to say 

that security initialization or CEMT PERFORM SECURITY REBUILD has failed. A third message follows either to say that CICS has terminated abnormally 

with a dump, or to ask you to reply GO or CANCEL. Depending on the nature of the original error, you may see messages from some other system 

component (for example, an access method).

 

User Response:  First, if CICS has requested a response, you must reply. If you reply 'GO', CICS continues processing, but without support for the external 

security manager. CICS security still operates. If you reply 'CANCEL', CICS terminates abnormally with a dump.

 

Use the messages and dumps to find out the cause of the failure.

 

Module:  DFHXSMN

 

AXSC

 

Explanation:  The task was purged before a GETMAIN request to the storage manager (SM) domain was able to complete successfully. The task that first 

detected the purged condition will have provided an exception trace.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Investigate why the task was purged. It was purged either as a result of a purge from the master terminal operator via the CEMT 

transaction, or by the task being timed out after waiting for longer than the DTIMOUT (deadlock timeout) value specified for the transaction.

 

If the master terminal operator purged the task, this may have been in an attempt to clear the system which appeared to be deadlocked for some reason.

 

If the task was timed out automatically as a result of the DTIMOUT value being exceeded, this may be due to insufficient main storage being available for the 

number of tasks in the system. If the amount of main storage cannot be increased, reduce the number of tasks in the system to avoid short-on-storage 

situations. Another possibility is to increase the value of the DTIMOUT option for the transaction.

 

Module:  DFHXSMN

User Response:  Check the connection to the remote CICS system and try to reestablish it.

 

Module:  DFHXTP

 

AXTL

 

Explanation:  The processing of APPC mapped data requires the generation of an APPC attach FMH with default values. In particular, the sync level 

requested is defaulted to 2. However, the session that is to be used has been bound with a sync level of 1.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Check that:

 

   The entry in the TCT for the remote system has been defined with parallel sessions

   The remote system is capable of supporting a sync level of 2.

 

   Exchange lognames has completed for the connection. You can use the command CEMT INQUIRE CONNECTION to do this. See the CICS 

 

    Intercommunication Guide for more details of the exchange lognames process.


   The correct sync level has been requested.

 

 

Module:  DFHXTP

 

AXTM

 

Explanation:  An attempt has been made to route a message-protected transaction over an APPC link bound at sync level 1. The attempt has failed 

because such transactions can be routed only over an APPC link that has been bound at sync level 2.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  If the transaction is to be routed to CICS OS/2 (which is bound at synclevel 1), remove the message protection option. If the transaction is 

to be routed to another host system and message protection is required, the link must be redefined so that it can be bound at synclevel 2.

 

Module:  DFHXTP

 

AXTN

 

Explanation:  Module DFHXTP detected that the application buffer chained off a TCTTE at offset TCTERCSA has a corrupted header. This is caused either 

by a CICS logic error or by a storage overwrite.

Determination Guide for guidance on how to proceed.

 

Module:  DFHETL

 

AXTO

 

Explanation:  An exception response has been returned to the DFHXTP module from the CICS security manager. Prior to the call to the CICS security 

manager, the DFHXTP module detected that a shipped terminal definition had preset security. DFHXTP then invoked the CICS security manager in order to 

perform a preset security signon for the userid sent with the shipped terminal information. It is this preset security signon attempt which failed.

 

System Action:  The transaction routing request is terminated and a message is sent to the terminal owning region (TOR) to indicate that the transaction 

routing request has failed. The CICS security manager issues a DFHSNxxxx message to the transient data queue, CSCS.

 

User Response:  The most likely cause of this abend is that the terminal being shipped to the application owning region (AOR) has preset security with a 

userid which is not valid in the AOR. To confirm this, check the associated DFHSNxxxx message on the CSCS transient data queue in the AOR which gives 

the precise reason for the failure of the preset security signon request. This could be the result of an unauthorized transaction routing request.

 

Module:  DFHXTP

 

AXTP

 

Explanation:  An exception response has been returned to the DFHXTP module from DFHCCNV FUNCTION(CONVERT_DS3270_FOR_SBCS). The module 

was called for a CICS client virtual terminal which requested conversion from ASCII to EBCDIC for data coming from the client. However, the conversion failed.

 

System Action:  The transaction routing request is terminated and a message is sent to the terminal owning region (TOR) to indicate that the transaction 

routing request has failed. The CICS security manager issues a DFHSNnnnn message to the transient data queue, CSCS.

 

User Response:  Examine the response and reason returned in the DFHCCNV commarea DFHC32. The client and server codepages will have already been 

validated so this may be a CICS error. You may need to contact IBM for further assistance. You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. 

See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to proceed.

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. CICS processing continues.

 

User Response:  You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to 

proceed.

 

Module(s): DFHZARM

 

AZCB

 

Explanation:  CICS has received sense code X'088901xx' during APPC mapped processing. This should be followed by an error data GDS (generalized data 

stream) variable.

 

CICS has attempted to receive the error data. However this attempt has failed because no data has been received or because the data received is not for an 

CICS ISSUE ERROR of the correct length.

 

CICS expects the error data to indicate that the other system does not recognize GDS ID X'12F2' (function management data).

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

The erroneous GDS ID is returned to the remote system for further analysis there.

User Response:  Check that the remote system can support application function management data.

 

Module(s): DFHZARM

 

 

 

 

AZCD

 

Explanation:  A possible intersystem logic error has been detected during APPC mapped processing. The length of application data that is to be received 

(as determined from the LL fields and concatenation flags) does not match the length actually received. CICS determines the length of application data that is 

to be received from the LL fields and concatenation flags. However, CICS has not received all of the data that is expected.

 

This abend can be caused by a loss of data following the failure of a persistent sessions restart in a partner system. In this case, no logic error has occurred 

because any updates are backed out.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  If this abend is not caused by the failure of a persistent sessions restart in a partner system, you will need further assistance from IBM. 

You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to proceed.

Module:  DFHZARM

 

AZCL

 

Explanation:  CICS has received sense code X'088901xx' during APPC mapped processing. The generalized data stream (GDS) should contain a valid GDS 

identity in the error data but CICS does not recognize the value. The values recognized by CICS are:

 

  X'12F1' null data

  X'12F2' function management data

  X'12FF' application data.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Check for session failure and for an abend by the transaction in the other system.

 

Module:  DFHZARM

 

AZCM

 

Explanation:  An error (INVALID, DISASTER, or unexpected EXCEPTION response) has occurred on a call to the storage manager (SM) domain. The 

domain that detected the original error provides an exception trace, a console message and, possibly, a system dump (depending on the options specified in 

the dump table).

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  See the related message produced by the domain that detected the original error.

 

Module:  DFHZARM

 

AZCN

 

Explanation:  The task has been purged before a GETMAIN request to the storage manager (SM) domain was able to complete successfully. The task that 

first detected the purged condition provides an exception trace.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Investigate why the task was purged. It was purged either as a result of a purge from the master terminal operator via the CEMT 

transaction, or by the task being timed out after waiting for longer than the DTIMOUT (deadlock timeout) value specified for the transaction.

 

If the master terminal operator purged the task, this may have been in an attempt to clear the system which appeared to be deadlocked for some reason.

 

If the task was timed out automatically as a result of the DTIMOUT value being exceeded, this may be due to insufficient main storage being available for the 

number of tasks in the system. If the amount of main storage cannot be increased, reduce the number of tasks in the system to avoid short-on-storage 

situations. Another possibility is to increase the value of the DTIMOUT option for the transaction.

 

Module:  DFHZARM

 

AZCO

 

Explanation:  The VTAM persistent sessions initialization transaction CGRP has been started directly from a terminal. This is not permitted. This 

transaction can only be started internally by CICS.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  None.

 

Module:  DFHZCGRP

 

 

 

 

AZCP

 

Explanation:  A logic error has been detected in ZCP. An allocation request for a starting task cannot be satisfied.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to 

proceed.

 

Modules: DFHZSUP DFH62XM

 

AZCQ

 

Explanation:  An error (INVALID, DISASTER or unexpected EXCEPTION response) has occurred on a call to the recovery manager (RM) domain to change 

the recovery status of an intercommunication session. The domain provides an exit trace, and possibly a console message and a system dump (depending 

on the options specified in the dump table).

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  This failure is either the result of a task purge, or it represents a CICS logic error and you will need assistance from IBM.

 

See the related diagnostic material produced by the recovery manager domain.

 

Modules: DFHZSUP DFHMRXM DFH62XM

 

 

 

 

AZCR

 

Explanation:  A logic or protocol error has been detected during processing of an APPC SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK request. An attempt has been made to 

restore the conversation state to what it was after completion of the last successful unit of work. This saved state does not match flows received from the 

partner.

 

The problem arises during rollback in one of the following situations:

 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The saved state is receive, and the partner sent change direction on the last flow, indicating that the partner expects CICS to be in send state

 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The saved state is send, and the partner did not send the change-direction indicator on the last flow, indicating that the partner expects CICS to be in 

 

    receive state.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump. Other processing continues.

 

User Response:  The problem can arise because of a failure in CICS, or a failure in the partner. To determine which is failing, analyze the flows at the last 

successful syncpoint. Try to determine the states the two LUs were in at this point. Look at the last syncpoint flow into CICS from the partner, before the 

abend. From this flow, calculate whether the change-direction indicator on the SPCMOD modifier byte is on. ( See the SNA Formats manual for further 

information on the SPCMOD modifier byte.) The indicator must only be set when the saved CICS conversation state is send. If the last CICS state was send, 

and the indicator is on, CICS is at fault. Similarly, if the last CICS state was receive, and the indicator is off, CICS is at fault.

 

If the last CICS state was send and the indicator is off, or the last CICS state was receive, and the indicator is on, CICS has received a change-direction 

indicator when it was not expecting one. In this case, examine the partner for a logic error.

 

Module:  DFHZARL

 

AZCT

 

Explanation:  A terminal read-time-out condition has been detected. The transaction has been waiting for a terminal input message for an interval longer 

than specified in the RTIMOUT value for that transaction.

 

Coding RTIMOUT in the PROFILE entry causes the task to be abnormally terminated if the terminal does not send input within the specified time.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated. A dump is not provided unless the dump table entry for transaction dump code AZCT indicates 

that one should be taken.

 

User Response:  If a HANDLE ABEND command has been issued for this task, the read that was timed-out is still outstanding. In order to cancel this read, 

issue an ABEND command at the end of the user exit routine so that CICS can clean up the terminal's TCTTE. No further terminal control commands should 

be issued.

 

Module:  DFHZARQ

 

AZCU

 

Explanation:  The COVR transaction has been started directly from a terminal, or by a START command. This is not permitted. This transaction can only be 

started internally by CICS.

Module:  DFHZCSTP

 

AZIA

 

Explanation:  The transaction attempted to acquire or free storage during MRO processing.  The response from the CICS storage manager (SM) domain 

indicated that the request was invalid.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a dump.

 

User Response:  You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to 

proceed.

 

Module:  DFHZIS2

 

AZIB

 

Explanation:  The transaction was purged whilst waiting for storage to receive MRO data from a connected subsystem. The purge may have been the result 

of operator action, such as CEMT SET TASK PURGE, or as the result of the waiting time exceeding the DTIMOUT value for the transaction.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a dump.

 

User Response:  If the condition is caused by time-out, examine the DTIMOUT value for the failing transaction and increase it if it is too low.

 

Module:  DFHZIS2

 

AZIC

 

Explanation:  An INVALID, DISASTER, or EXCEPTION condition has occurred on a call to the storage manager domain (DFHSMGFM) to FREEMAIN a 

CRB control block.

 

The domain that detected the original error provides an exception trace, a console message, and possibly a system dump.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Please see the related message from the domain that detected the original error.

 

Module:  DFHZIS2

 

AZID

 

Explanation:  A PURGED condition has occurred on a call to the storage manager domain (DFHSMGFM) to FREEMAIN a CRB control block.

 

The domain that detected the original error provides an exception trace.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Investigate why the task was purged. It was purged either as a result of a purge from the master terminal operator via the CEMT 

transaction, or by the task being timed out after waiting for longer than the DTIMOUT (deadlock timeout) value specified for the transaction.

 

If the master terminal operator purged the task, this may have been in an attempt to clear the system which appeared to be deadlocked for some reason.

 

If the task was timed out automatically as a result of the DTIMOUT value being exceeded, this may be due to insufficient main storage being available for the 

number of tasks in the system. If the amount of main storage cannot be increased, reduce the number of tasks in the system to avoid short-on-storage 

situations. Another possibility is to increase the value of the DTIMOUT option for the transaction.

 

Module:  DFHZIS2

 

AZIE

 

Explanation:  An interregion communication (IRC) ISSUE-ERROR or ISSUE-ABEND flow has been received in violation of IRC protocols. This can be 

caused by:

 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A CICS logic error. IRC protocols are not available to MRO distributed transaction processing applications. They are for CICS internal use only.

 

 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A transaction abend on a connected system. This results in an FMH 7 flow over an LU6.2 connection and causes this abend to be issued.

 

 

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Check whether a mixture of mapped and unmapped conversations are being used as this can cause this abend. Check for any other 

reasons for transactions to be abending on the attached system.

 

If a CICS logic error is involved, you will need further assistance from IBM. You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the 

CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to proceed.

 

Module:  DFHZARQ

 

AZIF

 

Explanation:  An error (INVALID, DISASTER or unexpected EXCEPTION response) has occurred on a call to the recovery manager (RM) domain to change 

the recovery status of an intercommunication session. The domain provides an exit trace, and possibly a console message and a system dump (depending 

on the options specified in the dump table).

 

This is either the result of a task purge, a CICS logic error, or of the inappropriate use of the indoubt test transaction, CIND. CIND should be activated only on 

the CICS system where the syncpoint processing was initiated. In particular, CIND should not be used on any of the CICS mirror transactions.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Determine whether CIND has been activated for a transaction that did not initiate the syncpoint processing.  If CIND is not being used see 

the related diagnostic material produced by the recovery manager domain and determine the reason for the failure.

 

In the case of a CICS logic error, you need further assistance from IBM. You need further assistance from IBM to resolve this problem. See Part 4 of the 

CICS Problem Determination Guide for guidance on how to proceed.

 

Module:  DFHZARQ

 

AZI1

 

Explanation:  An IRC data transmission request has been issued, but cannot be completed because the transmission protocol has been violated.

 

If the session is not used for distributed transaction processing, that is if it is used for function shipping or transaction routing, then the problem is caused by 

a CICS logic error.

 

If the session is used for distributed transaction processing, then the following are possible causes of the abend:

 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   An invalid terminal control command, such as ISSUE SIGNAL, was issued

 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A send request was issued but the session was not in send state, or a read request was issued but the session was not in receive state.

 

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  Determine the cause of the abend and if appropriate, correct the application.  For further guidance, refer to the section on the EXEC 

Interface block (EIB) in the CICS Intercommunication Guide. The EIB describes the state of the session after a request has been issued.

 

Module:  DFHZARQ

 

AZI2

 

Explanation:  An IRC data transmission request has been issued but cannot be completed.  Possible causes of the problem include:

 

   The transaction running in the connected system has been purged, or

   The transaction running in the connected system has been timed out, or

   The abending transaction has attempted to SEND while in RECEIVE state, or

   The abending transaction has attempted to RECEIVE while in SEND state.

 

 

If the abend was caused by DFHIRP rejecting the transmission request, the dump will contain DFHIRP's return code in the field TCTEIRET for the TCTTE 

representing the failed IRC session. The address of this TCTTE is in field B of the trace entry representing the DFHTC data transmission request.

 

The meanings of the DFHIRP return codes are given in the copybook, DFHIRSDS.

 

System Action:  The task is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  If the cause of the error was a purge or a time-out, no further action is required.

 

If the error was caused by a condition such as an attempted SEND while in RECEIVE state or vice versa, analyze the dump and correct the protocol violation.

 

Module:  DFHZARQ

Module:  DFHZARR0

 

AZRE

 

Explanation:  The logical APPC receive buffer (addressed by TCTERBLA) starts before or after the physical receive buffer (addressed by TCTERBLA). This 

is not valid as the logical receive buffer is the part of the physical receive buffer that is yet to be processed. This problem could be caused either by a storage 

overwrite or by a CICS internal logic error.

 

System Action:  The transaction is abnormally terminated with a CICS transaction dump.

 

User Response:  If this problem is reproducible then a level 1 and 2 trace of the TC component would aid problem determination. Check the TCTTE in the
